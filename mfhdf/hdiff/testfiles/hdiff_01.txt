  [-e count]        Print difference up to count number for each variable
  [-t limit]        Print difference when it is greater than limit

Items in [] are optional
The 'count' value must be a positive integer
The 'limit' and 'relative' values must be positive numbers
The -t compare criteria is |a - b| > limit
The -p compare criteria is |(b-a)/a| > relative
return code: 0 - no differences found; 1 - differences found
