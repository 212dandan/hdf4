This directory contains a beta test version of hdp -- an HDF dumper.
File hdp.txt explains hdp commands and command options. Hdp will be
automatically compiled and installed when you run 'make' and
'make install' from the top level. There is no auto-test available 
yet. A file named TEST and a group of .hdf files are included for 
testing. 

At this moment hdp works on SunOS and LINUX only. It has different
problems on other platforms. Dumpsds doesn't work on Solaris, HP, 
and DecAlpha/OSF; dumpvd and dumpvg don't work on IBM RS6000/AIX,
IRIX5.3, HP, DecAlpha/OSF, DecStation/Ultrix, Convex and 
IRIX6.0 32bit mode. Those problems will be fixed in next release. 

Please send your bug reports, comments and suggestions to 
hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu.
