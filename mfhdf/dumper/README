This directory contains a beta test version of hdp -- an HDF dumper.
File hdp.txt explains hdp commands and command options. Hdp will be
automatically compiled and installed when you run 'make' and
'make install' from the top level. There is no auto-test available 
yet. A group of .hdf files are included for testing.  

Please send your bug reports, comments and suggestions to 
hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu.
