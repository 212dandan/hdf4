New features and changes
========================
    Configuration
    ============= 
        - The default installation directory name was changed from "NewHDF" 
          to "hdf4".                            EIP - 2007/08/06
        - Introduced --enable-netcdf configure flag to provide an option to
          enable/disable "HDF4-NetCDF"-like interfaces. By default, the 
          HDF4 netcdf feature is enabled.  Use the --disable-netcdf 
          configuration flag to build HDF4 C and Fortran libraries that can 
          be used by NetCDF-3 applications. There is no longer a need to 
          specify the -DHAVE_NETCDF compilation flag.  This feature is not 
          yet supported on Windows.             EIP - 2007/09/05
        - Updated versions of autotools. HDF4 now uses automake 1.10.0,
          autoconf 2.61, and libtool 1.5.22.    MAM - 2007/7/25.
        - The Fortran part of the HDF4 library uses the F77_FUNC macro to 
          mangle names of C functions called from Fortran APIs. This should 
          help with HDF4 code portability to different Fortran compilers.
                                                EIP - 2006/12/19
     
    Library
    ========= 
        - SZIP compression is supported now for GR C interfaces
                                                EIP - 2007/09/15
        - Added new Fortran function hconfinf that determines whether the 
          SZIP compression method is present and whether encoding is available.
        - Added support for SZIP compression in Fortran.
                                                EIP - 2007/09/01
        - The following APIs were added; see "Bugs fixed" section for details.
          SDreset_maxopenfiles -- Resets the maximum number of files that can 
                  be open at a time.
          SDget_maxopenfiles -- Retrieves the current number of open files
                  allowed in HDF and the maximum number of open files allowed 
                  on a system.
          SDget_numopenfiles -- Returns the number of files currently open.
          SDgetcompinfo -- Replaces SDgetcompress.
          GRgetcompinfo -- Replaces GRgetcompress.
          SDgetfilename -- Retrieves the name of the file, given its ID.
          SDgetnamelen -- Retrieves the name length of the object, given its ID.
          Note: Fortran wrappers for these new APIs are not available in this 
          release.  BMR - 2007/09/23
        - SDS and vgroup names are no longer limited to 64 characters
          (Bugzilla #516).  Note that when an older version of the library 
          reads a new name that is longer than 64 characters, the name will
          contain some garbage after 64 characters.  BMR - 2006/10/12
        - User reported that SDreaddata went into an infinite loop when 
          reading some corrupted compressed data.  This problem is fixed.
          Two new error codes were added, consequently:
                DFE_READCOMP  - when the zlib function returns
                        Z_ERRNO        (-1) or
                        Z_STREAM_ERROR (-2) or
                        Z_DATA_ERROR   (-3) or
                        Z_MEM_ERROR    (-4) or
                        Z_BUF_ERROR    (-5)

                DFE_COMPVERSION - when the zlib function returns
                        Z_VERSION_ERROR (-6)


    Utilities
    ========= 
        - hrepack repacks by hyperslabs for large (non-compressed) datasets.
                                                         PVN - 2007/7/10
        - hdiff enables reading by hyperslabs. This feature was added to 
          handle very large datasets, where available memory is a isssue. 
                                                         PVN - 2007/6/13
        - hdiff now shows indices in multidimensional array notation. 
                                                         PVN - 2007/4/5
        - hdiff now shows the name of the array when printing differences. 
                                                         PVN - 2007/4/5
        - hdiff now shows a list of all objects in verbose mode. 
                                                         PVN - 2007/4/5
        - hdiff return code is now 1 if differences are found, 0 if no
          differences are found, and -1 for an error.    PVN - 2007/4/5
        - hdiff has a new option, -p, for relative error. See usage. 
                                                         PVN - 2007/4/5
        - hrepack now prints chunk information along with the compression 
          type in verbose mode.                          PVN - 2007/4/5
         

Support for new platforms and compilers
=======================================
        - Added support for gfortran and g95 on Mac Intel.
                                       EIP 2007/09/14
        - Added support for gfortran on FreeBSD for both 32- and 64-bit. 
        - Added support for FreeBSD on AMD64 with gcc compilers.
                                       EIP 2007/05/24
        - Added support for MAC OS X Intel with gcc and g95 compilers.
        - Added support for SUNOS 5.10 on Intel with SUN compilers (32- and
          64-bit modes).               EIP 2006/12/14
        - Added support for HPUX 11.23 (32- and 64-bit modes).
                                        EIP 2006/12/19

Bugs fixed since HDF4.2r1
=========================
     Utilities
    ========= 
        - hrepack: Repeated vgroup insertions (duplicated links) were not being 
          replicated.  PVN - 2007/9/10
        - hrepack: Improved performance for large number of SDSs, through the 
          elimination of redundant file open calls.  PVN - 2007/4/5
        - hrepack: Fixed a bug in the -t option so that it now accepts multiple
          comma-separated names.  PVN - 2007/4/5
        - hrepack: Now duplicates dimension SDSs that are not accessed from any 
          other SDSs.  PVN - 2007/4/5
        - hrepack: Fixed a bug that caused the unchunking of a dataset when
          uncompressing was requested.  PVN - 2007/4/5

    Library
    ========= 
        - Added display of the compression method to hdp dumpsds and dumpgr
          (Bugzilla #130).  BMR - 2005/4/4
        - The current SDgetcompress and GRgetcompress APIs have severe flaws.
          Two new APIs, SDgetcompinfo and GRgetcompinfo, were added to 
          provide better functionality and will eventually replace 
          SDgetcompress and GRgetcompress.  BMR - 2005/4/4
        - Applied user's patch to fix bug #602.  BMR - 2005/4/23
        - Added a switch ('u') to ncdump to replace nonalpha-numeric characters
          with underscores.  Thus, the SDS names won't be changed automatically 
          unless the user so requests (Access bug #934/Bugzilla #381).
          BMR - 2005/7/17
        - In HDF4.2r0, SDwritedata failed when the SDS had rank=0 (bug #1045).
          This change was retracted; writing to an SDS with rank=0 is allowed 
          again.  BMR - 2005/8/23
        - When a dimension has the same name as an SDS, depending on the
          order in which they were created, either the SDS or the dimension
          will be corrupted if certain operations occur, such as a SDsetdimscale
          or SDsetattr call to the dimension.  With this bugfix, the current 
          situation can be summarized as below:
              + Data that has already been corrupted cannot be recovered.
              + For existing data that has not yet been corrupted, the problem 
                has been fixed for multi-dimensional SDSs only.  If the SDS had
                only one dimension, the results of subsequent accesses to the 
                dimension would still be unpredictable (Bugzilla #328).  
                BMR - 2005/8/23
              + For future data, the problem has been fixed (Bugzilla #624).
                BMR - 2007/6/24
        - Allowing the maximum number of open files to be increased revealed
          a problem: having more than 255 files open will cause file
          corruption (Bugzilla #440).  Specifically, file number (255*m)+n 
          will overwrite file number n, where n is [0..255] and m is [1..p], 
          where (255*p) <= maximum system allowed.  This problem is fixed.
          In addition, a new API is added for convenience:
                SDgetfilename -- retrieves the name of the file given its ID.
          BMR - 2005/10/05
        - Prior to this release, the maximum number of files that can be open
          at the same time was only 32. This limit was implemented as a 
          defined constant in the library, which users could not change without 
          recompiling the library. In this release, if this limit is reached, 
          the library will increase it to the system limit, minus 3 to account 
          for stdin, stdout, and stderr.  In addition, three APIs are added 
          for more flexibility (Bugzilla #396/Access bug #935):  
                SDreset_maxopenfiles -- Resets the maximum number of files 
                        that can be open at a time.
                SDget_maxopenfiles -- Retrieves the current number of open 
                        files allowed in HDF and the maximum number of open 
                        files allowed on a system.
                SDget_numopenfiles -- Returns the number of files currently 
                        open.
          Note:
            (1) Because there are also stdin, stdout, and stderr, the maximum
                limit that can be set must only be (system limit) - 3.
            (2) If the system maximum limit is reached, the library will 
                push the error code DFE_TOOMANY onto the error stack.
                The user application can detect this after an SDstart fails.
          BMR - 2005/10/21
        - The problem where ncgen failed with "too many attributes" on 
          some user files is fixed (Bugzilla #373).  BMR - 2005/10/28
        - The problem where SDcheckempty returns "not empty" for empty 
          chunked and compressed datasets is fixed (Bugzilla #218).
          BMR - 2005/10/31
        - If a VSgetattr was called twice for an attribute, the second call 
          would fail (Bugzilla #486).  This problem is fixed.  BMR - 2005/12/30
        - A bug with reading metadata in hdfimport is fixed (Bugzilla #558).
          BMR - 2006/9/23
        - The problem of writing to two unlimited 1-D arrays is fixed
          (Access bug #525).  BMR - 2006/11/11

Known problems
==============

o  hdfcomp fails on HPUX 11.23 for the 64-bit version of the library

o  This release does not support VMS systems.

o  N-Bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets does not work.

o  When a one-dimensional SDS has the same name as the dimension, subsequent
   accesses to the dimension produce unpredictable results.

o  When using PGI compilers, make sure that the JPEG library is also compiled 
   with a PGI C compiler; linking with JPEG built with gcc causes JPEG library 
   tests to fail.  To bypass the problem:

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
         where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installation directory
         for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use the --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR configure flag to 
         configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....
