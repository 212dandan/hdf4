INTRODUCTION

This document describes the differences between HDF 4.2.6 and HDF 4.2.6-post*.

and wish to migrate to HDF 4.2.6-post*.

Known problems
==============

o  On IBM PowerPC 64 hdftest failes when gcc 4.4.6 is used with -O3 optimization level. 

o  Wnen buidling in AIX systems, if CC is xlc with -qlanglvl=ansi, configure
   fails when checking for the jpeglib.h header due to the duplicated
   macro definition of HAVE_STDLIB_H.  This is because some newer builds
   of jpeg library has HAVE_STDLIB_H defined in its jconfig.h header file.
   Without the -qlanglvl=ansi, some older xlc (e.g., V7.0) still fails but
   newer xlc (e.g., V9.0) passes.  AKC - 2010/02/17

o  When building on Linux/UNIX platforms, the szip shared library files must
   be in the system library path. This can be done by adding a link to
   the libsz.* files into the /usr/lib folder or by adding the library
   location to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
      Ex. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_to_szip_lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   Optionally, one can use the static szip library files by adding '-static'
   to the CFLAGS environment variable.
   
o  Existing data written by an HDF4 Library prior to HDF 4.2r2:
   When a one-dimensional SDS and a dimension scale have
   the same name, subsequent accesses to the dimension scale or to the
   SDS might produce undesired results because the libraries could not
   distinguish between the two objects.  In the case of writing, data
   might even be corrupted.  For example, SDS data might be written to a
   dimension variable or vice versa.

   HDF4 Library Releases 4.2r2 and later make a distinction between an SDS
   and a dimension variable.  However, as older versions, these recent
   versions are unable to detect such conflicts in existing files,
   specifically, those created by earlier releases.  It is therefore STRONGLY
   recommended to check for such name duplication before working with data
   created with a pre-4.2r2 library.

   The functions SDgetnumvars_byname and SDnametoindices are provided
   to help detect such name conflicts and select the correct object to
   access, respectively; see the HDF Reference Manual entries for
   further details.

o  This release does not support VMS systems.

o  N-Bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets does not work.

o  When using PGI compilers, make sure that the JPEG library is also compiled 
   with a PGI C compiler; linking with a JPEG library built with gcc causes 
   JPEG library tests to fail.  To bypass the problem:

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
         where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installation directory
         for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use the --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR configure flag to 
         configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....

o  In order for the API SDgetdatasize to get the correct compressed size
   of the data, the dataset needs to be closed (SDendaccess) or read
   (SDreaddata), after being written and before SDgetdatasize is called.
