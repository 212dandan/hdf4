New Features and Changes:
========================
    Configuration
    ============= 
     
    Library
    ========= 
	- The current SDgetcompress and GRgetcompress have severe flaws.
	  Two new APIs, SDgetcompinfo and GRgetcompinfo, were added to 
	  provide better functionality and will replace SDgetcompress and
	  GRgetcompress, eventually. BMR - 2005/4/4

Known problems
==============

o  SZIP Library is not available for Crays SV1 and TS
   Fortran APIs do not support SZIP compression.

o SZIP compression cannot be used with GR interfaces. For more information
  see "HDF4.2r1 SZIP Release Notes" available at 
  http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/doc_resource/SZIP/SZIP_HDF4_2r1.pdf

o  This release doesn't support VMS system.

o  N-Bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets doesn't work.

o  SDgetdimscale incorrectly returns FAIL and or returns incorrect data
   when the associated SDS has the same name as the dimension.

o  When using PGI compilers make sure that JPEG library is also compiled with 
   PGI C compiler; linking with JPEG built with gcc causes JPEG library tests
   to fail.  To bypass the problem

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
          where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installtion directory
          for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

          setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use  --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR
         configure flag to configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

          ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....
