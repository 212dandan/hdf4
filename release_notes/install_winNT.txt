      Install HDF4.1 Release 2 on Windows NT and Windows 95, and Alpha NT.

Since Windows NT, Windows '95 (Chicago) and Windows 3.1
(with the Win 32s extensions) all are designed to run the same 32-bit code, our 
decision is to support only 32-bit libraries and code on the MS-Windows 
platform. We are not planning on supporting any 16-bit versions in the 
foreseeable future.

The instructions which follow assume that you will be using one of 
the 'zip' files that we provide, either the binary code release
(hdf41r2.zip) or the source code release (hdf41r2s.zip).
In building HDF from source code you may select between 
two build environment options depending on your
application and environment needs.  Each option has it's own zip file:


Option I, (select Win32nof.zip)
Test and Utility configuration : HDF library, tests, and utilities, no fortran,
available for Win32 Intel platform only.

Option II, (select Win32full.zip)
Full configuration : HDF library, tests, and utilities, with fortran
This version has been built and tested using DEC Visual Fortran on both
the Win32 Intel platform and the Win32 Alpha platform.



Building from Binary Code Release (hdf41r2.zip)
===============================================
To install the HDF, JPEG, zlib and mfhdf libraries and utilities, 
it is assumed that you have done the following:
      

      1. Create a directory structure to unpack the library. For 
      example: 

	    c:\					(any drive)
           MyHDFstuff\				(any folder name)

      2. Copy the binary archive (HDF41r2.zip) to that directory 
      and unpack it by running WinZip on HDF41r2.zip (the binary archive).
      This should create a directory called 'HDF41r2' which 
      contains the following files and directories.

            c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF41r2\lib             ( Debug and Release versions of HDF libraries )
            c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF41r2\include         ( HDF include files )
            c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF41r2\bin             ( HDF utilities files )
            c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF41r2\release_notes   ( release notes )
            c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF41r2\install_NT_95   ( this file)

      
      3. If you are building an application that uses the HDF library 
         the following locations will need to be specified for locating
         header files and linking in the HDF libraries:
 
            C:\MyHDFstuff\HDF41r2\lib
            C:\MyHDFstuff\HDF41r2\include





Building from Source Code Release (hdf41r2s.zip)
===============================================

STEP I:  Preconditions

To build the HDF, JPEG, zlib and mfhdf libraries and utilities, 
it is assumed that you have done the following:
      
      1. Installed MicroSoft Developer Studio, and Visual C++ 5.0.
         Visual Fortran 5.0 is needed if you are going to build the
         full HDF Library with Fortran support.

      2. Set up a directory structure to unpack the library. For 
      example: 

	    c:\					(any drive)
           MyHDFstuff\				(any folder name)

      3. Copy the source distribution archive to that directory 
      and unpack it using the appropriate archiver options to
      create a directory  hierarchy.
         
      Run WinZip on HDF41r2s.zip (the entire source tree).
      This should create a directory called 'HDF41r2' which 
      contains several files and directories.
      
      ( Note for those using the Win32 Alpha platform:
        If you do not have a Winzip utility for your Alpha system
        you can download the needed executables from: 
        http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip ) 
       
STEP II: Select Installation type and Build.

You may select one of 2 ways to build the HDF library and 
utilities, depending on your environment and application needs.

Option I, (select Win32nof.zip)
Test and Utility configuration : HDF library, tests, and utilities, no fortran

Option II, (select Win32full.zip)
Full configuration : HDF library, tests, and utilities, with fortran



STEP III: Follow Instructions for Option I, or II


INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPTION I, TEST AND UTILITY INSTALLATION, NO FORTRAN
                 (Win32 Intel platform only)

               This archive contains a Developer Studio project "dev" and 
               two batch files. 
               40 project files (*.dsp files) will be created when 
               Win32nof.zip is expanded.

         2. Invoke Microsoft Visial C++ 5.0, go to "File" and select
            "Open Workspace" option. 
            Then open  c:\myHDFstuff\HDF41r2\dev.dsw workspace.

       subdirectories bin\, include\ and lib\ in HDF41r2\. The bin dirctory
       will contain the HDF utilities, the include directory will contain 
       header files, and the lib directory will contain:

           Select "Build" and "Build dev.exe" to
           build the Debug version of the HDF41r2 tree.
           You will see that Digital Visual Fortran compiler is invoked
           by Visual C++ Development environment in compiling the fortran code.

STEP IV:

BUILDING AN APPLICATION USING THE HDF LIBRARY - SOME HELPFUL POINTERS
=====================================================================

If you are building an application that uses the HDF library 
the following locations will need to be specified for locating
header files and linking in the HDF libraries:
 
            <top-level HDF directory>\lib
            <top-level HDF directory>\include

where <top-level HDF directory> may be C:\myHDFstuff\dev or C:\MyHDFstuff\HDF41r2\

Please refer to the <top-level HDF directory>\release_notes\compile.txt file
for more information on compiling an application with the HDF libraries.


MORE HELPFUL POINTERS
=====================
(as described in terms of installing the  nofortran configuration)

Here are some notes that may be of help if you are not familiar
with using the Visual C++ Development Environment.

Project name and location issues: 
         The files in Win32nof.zip must end up in the HDF41r2\ directory
         installed by HDF41r2s.zip

         If you must install dev.dsw and dev.dsp in 
         another directory, relative to HDF41r2\ , you will be asked to
	 locate the above 5 sub-project files, when you open the
	 project dev.dsw.
	 
	 If you want to rename dev (the entire project),
	 you will need to modify two files
	 dev.dsw and dev.dsp as text
	 (contrary to the explicit warnings in the files).

	 You can also modify dev.dsw and dev.dsp
	 as text, to allow these 2 files to be installed
	 in another directory.



  Settings... details:
  If you create your own project, the necessary settings can be
  read from the dev.dsp file(as text), or from the
  Project Settings in the Developer Studio project settings 
dialog.
