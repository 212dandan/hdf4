JPEG Group v5b library
    Version 4.0 of the HDF-netCDF library now uses v5 of the Independent
JPEG Group (IJG) JPEG file access library.  For most users of the HDF library,
this will be completely transparent.  For users who are integrating the HDF
library into an existing application which uses the IJG's JPEG library, linking
with the HDF library is now much simpler and should be completely painless.
The JPEG library will need to be linked with user's applications when raster
images are being used (whether they are compressed with JPEG or not).

     cc -o <myprog> myprog.c -I<include path> <path for libnetcdf.a> \
           <path for libdf.a> <path for libjpeg.a>

     Note: order of the libraries is important.
