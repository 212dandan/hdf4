New Compression Algorithms and interface
    A new low-level compression interface has been added to the HDF-netCDF
library which allows any data-object to be compressed using a variety of
algorithms.  This new feature of the library is completely transparent to
users once the data has been compressed initially - further data written
to an object or read from it are compressed or decompressed internally to
the library without user intervention.  Currently only two compression
algorithms are supported: Run-Length Encoding (RLE) and adaptive Huffman.
Plans for future algorithms include an Lempel/Ziv-77 dictionary coding, an
Lempel/Ziv-78 dictionary coding and an arithmetic coder.
    The public interface for this new feature is contained in one new
user-level function call, HCcreate.  The interface to HCcreate described below:

int32 HCcreate(id,tag,ref,model_type,m_info,coder_type,c_info);
    int32 id;                IN: the file id to create the data in (from Hopen)
    uint16 tag,ref;          IN: the tag/ref pair of the data-object which
                                    is to be compressed
    comp_model_t model_type; IN: the type of modeling to use, currently
                                    only COMP_MODEL_STDIO is supported, which
                                    indicates data is transferred in the
                                    same way as C I/O functions operate.
    model_info *m_info;      IN: Information needed for the modeling type chosen
                                    Nothing needed for COMP_MODEL_STDIO,
                                    so NULL can be used.
    comp_coder_t coder_type; IN: the type of encoding to use from the following:
                                    COMP_CODE_NONE - for no compression
                                    COMP_CODE_RLE - for RLE encoding
                                    COMP_CODE_SKPHUFF - for adaptive Huffman
    coder_info *c_info;      IN: Information needed for the encoding type chosen
                                    For COMP_CODE_NONE and COMP_CODE_RLE,
                                    this is unused and can be set to NULL.
                                    For COMP_CODE_SKPHUFF, the structure skphuff
                                    in this union needs information about the
                                    size of the data elements in bytes (see
                                    examples below).
    RETURNS
        Return an AID to the newly created compressed element, FAIL on error.

    HCcreate will compress an existing data-object with the specified 
compression method, or it can create a new data-object which will contain
compressed data when it is written to.  In either case, Hendaccess must be
called to release the AID allocated by HCcreate.  In the first two examples
below the datasets already exist, in the final example the dataset is created
by the HCcreate call.  There is currently no FORTRAN equivalent for this
function.

The following example shows how to compress a scientific dataset data-object
(which is composed of multi-dimensional 32-bit integer data) using the
adaptive Huffman encoding:
    {
        int32 aid;
        coder_info c_info;

        c_info.skphuff.skp_size=sizeof(int32);
        aid=HCcreate(file_id, DFTAG_SD, ref, COMP_MODEL_STDIO, NULL, 
            COMP_CODE_SKPHUFF,&c_info);
        .
        .
        <access data object>
        .
        .
        Hendaccess(aid);
    }

The following example shows show to compress a raster image data-object
using the RLE algorithm:
    {
        int32 aid;

        aid=HCcreate(file_id, DFTAG_RI, ref, COMP_MODEL_STDIO, NULL, 
            COMP_CODE_RLE,NULL);
        .
        .
        <access data object>
        .
        .
        Hendaccess(aid);
    }

The following example shows how to create a new data-object whose data
will compressed as it is written:
    {
        int32 aid;

        aid=HCcreate(file_id, DFTAG_RI, ref, COMP_MODEL_STDIO, NULL, 
            COMP_CODE_RLE,NULL);
        .
        .
        Hwrite(aid,len,data);
        .
        .
        Hendaccess(aid);
    }
