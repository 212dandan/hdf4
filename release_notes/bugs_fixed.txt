1. Added support to unsigned integers for attributes.
2. Bug fixed in SDsetdimscale if dim strings or other attributes already
   assigned to that dimension and if the size of the number type
   is not 4 bytes. 
3. Bug fixed in SDgetdimscale.  For dimensions that have no dim scale 
   SDgetdimscale now returns 0 for nt to indicate that  no-scale was assigned.
4. Several buffers allocated by Hxxxx, SDxxxx, and VSxxxx functions were 
   used through the entire excecution time of HDF application programs.
   In previous releases those buffers were not freed by HDF. Some debugging 
   tools list those buffers as memory leaks. In HDF4.0b1 those buffers are freed
   by HDF when the programs exit. The fix doesn't work on SunOS.  
5. Added Fortran version of VSQueryxxxx and VSfind:
     vsqfnelt -- VSQuerycount
     vsqfintr -- VSQueryinterlace
     vsqfflds -- VSQueryfields
     vsqfvsiz -- VSQuerysize
     vsqfname -- VSQueryname
     vsffnd   -- VSfind
6.  SDsetdimscale () did not set scales for unlimited dimension. 
    After appending records to the unlimited dimension, the number of 
    records was not updated.  The bug is fixed. 
7.  In previous releases, the Vdata interface couldn't define more than 36 
    fields even though VSFIELDMAX was defined as 64 in hdf.h. 
    The bug is fixed. Now the maximum number of fields is decided by
    VSFIELSMAX. 
8.  The Fortran function sfgdinfo now returns nattr correctly.
9.  hdfrseq is moved out from the HDF release. It is now available on the NCSA
    ftp server in directory: /HDF/contrib/NCSA/hdfrseq/.
10. If the same file is accessed twice with DFSDputdata (i.e. the file 
    is first destroyed), the first call to DFANputlabel after the second 
    call to DFSDputdata fails. To fix this problem, a new function 
    DFANclear has been added. 
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    Name:    DFANclear
    Purpose: Clear DFAN interface
    Inputs:  void
    Returns: SUCCEED if ok; FAIL otherwise.
    Remarks: When a file is re-created in a single run, user should
             call DFANclear() before the file is re-created to reset DFAN 
             interface structures.
    Example: 
             main()
             {
                  int ret;
                  dump(0);  /* DFSDputdata("myfile.hdf",...) is called  */
                            /* in dump() to create myfile.hdf  */
                  ret = DFANclear();
                  dump(1);  /* DFSDputdata("myfile.hdf",...) is called  */
                            /* again to re-create a file with the same  */
                            /* name myfile.hdf  */
             }

11. A bug is fixed in SDgetcal, which failed in getting number_type from 
    old hdf files, created by DFSDxxxx calls.  
12. hdf.inc missing constants and commas
13. HDgettagname() can't recognize DFTAG_FV and DFTAG_COMPRESSED
    in hkit.c  
14. fp2hdf is back in hdf/util/.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Known problems:
1. Need Fortran version of VFfieldxxxx functions.
2. Need an easy way to append to a vdata. One solution would be 
   to make all FULL_INTERLACE vdatas appendable.
3. Need a high level function to create external Vdata, similar to 
   SDsetexternalfile(). 
4. SDxxxx interface creates dummy values for dimension records. 
   For multi-dimensional SDS this isn't too bad. However, for 
   1-D SDS it doubles the size of the file.
