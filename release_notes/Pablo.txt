Pablo Instrumentation of HDF
===========================
    This version of the distribution has support to create an instrumented 
    version of the HDF library(libdf-inst.a). This library along with
    the Pablo performance data capture libraries can be used to gather data
    about I/O behavior and procedure execution times.  

    More detailed documentation on how to use the instrumented version of
    the HDF library with Pablo can be found in the Pablo directory 
    '$(toplevel)/hdf/pablo'. 
     See the provided '$(toplevel)/hdf/pablo/README.Pablo'
     and the Postscript file '$(toplevel)/hdf/pablo/Pablo.ps'.

    At this time only an instrumented version of the core HDF library libdf.a 
    can be created. Future versions will have support for the SDxx interface
    found in libmfhdf.a. Current interfaces supported are ANxx, GRxx, DFSDxx,
    DFANxx, DFPxx, DFR8xx, DF24xx, Hxx, Vxx, and VSxx.

    To enable the creation of an instrumented library the following section
    in the makefile fragment($(toplevel)/config/mh-<os>) must be uncommented 
    and set.

    # ------------ Macros for Pablo Instrumentation  --------------------
    # Uncomment the following lines to create a Pablo Instrumentation
    # version of the HDF core library called 'libdf-inst.a'
    # See the documentation in the directory 'hdf/pablo' for further 
    # information about Pablo and what platforms it is supported on
    # before enabling. 
    # You need to set 'PABLO_INCLUDE' to the Pablo distribution 
    # include directory to get the files 'IOTrace.h' and 'IOTrace_SD.h'.
    #PABLO_FLAGS  = -DHAVE_PABLO
    #PABLO_INCLUDE = -I/hdf2/Pablo/Instrument.HP/include

    After setting these values you must re-run the top-level 'configure' script.
    Make sure that your start from a clean re-build(i.e. 'make clean') after
    re-running the toplevel 'configure' script and then run 'make'.
    Details on running configure can be found in the section
    'General Configuration/Installation - Unix' found in the top-level 
    installation file '$(toplevel)/INSTALL'.
