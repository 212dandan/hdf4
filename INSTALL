Requirements
============

    To build both HDF and netCDF library from sources, you need:

      * ANSI C compilier. The native ANSI compiliers on the above 
        platforms are supported. On platforms where no ANSI compilier
        was available the free GNU ANSI compilier GCC was used.

      * Fortran 77 compilier if you want fortran support. See above
        table for platforms where fortran is supported. You can
        compile both libraries without fortran support by setting 
        the fortran compilier variable 'FC = NONE' in the respective
        makefile fragment(mh-<os>) found in the toplevel 'config'
        directory(config/mh-<os>).

        See below for further details of configuration and installation.
        

General Configuration/Installation - Unix
=========================================

    Overview
    --------        
    In this distribution there are two types of 'configure'
    scripts. One is the Cygnus 'configure' script and the other is the
    'configure' script created by the GNU autconf package. The Cygnus
    'configure' script is used at the top level to configure the overall
    distribution and the HDF/MFHDF library. The GNU 'configure' script
    is used by the netCDF distribution to configure itself. However, this
    gnu configure script is not used in configuring this distribution.
 
    The Cygnus 'configure' script attempts to guess the correct
    platform you are configuring the distribution for by calling the shell
    script 'config.guess'. It outputs a unique string based on information
    obtained from the UNIX command 'uname' consisting of CPU-VENDOR-OS
    e.g. 'hppa1.1-hp-hpux9.03' for an  HP9000/735 running HPUX-9.03.

    Layout of configuration files
    -----------------------------
    The following shows the layout of the files used in the configuration.
    NOTE: The mfhdf/CUSTOMIZE and mfhdf/configure(autoconf) files are no
          longer used in the configuration
  
    $(toplevel)/Makefile.in
                config.guess
                config.sub
                configure (cygnus)
                configure.in
                config/mh-hpux, mh-sun,.....
                      /custom_hpux, mh-sun,...

                mfhdf/libsrc/config/netcdf-aix.h, netcdf-alpha.h,...
                mfhdf/fortran/config/ftest-aix.f,...
                mfhdf/fortran/config/jackets-aix.c,..
                mfhdf/fortran/config/netcdf-aix.inc,..

                hdf/Makefile.in
                hdf/src/Makefile.in
                hdf/test/Makefile.in
                hdf/util/Makefile.in

                hdf/jpeg/configure.in
                hdf/jpeg/Makefile.in
                hdf/jpeg/configure.gnu
                hdf/jpeg/config/mh-hpux, mh-sun,...
                hdf/jpeg/config/jhpux.h, jsun.h,...

    Changing default values(CC,CFLAGS,..)
    -------------------------------------
    To change any of the default values for CC, FC, CFLAGS, FFLAGS,..etc
    edit the makefile fragment 'config/mh-<os>' for your particular
    operating system. After changing the values you must re-run the 
    toplevel 'configure' script. 

    Running configure
    -----------------
    To build both of the libraries contained in this directory,
    run the ``configure'' script int $(toplevel), e.g.:

	./configure -v --prefix=/usr/local/hdf

    If you're using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
    `sh ./configure -v --prefix=/usr/local/hdf' instead to prevent `csh' 
     from trying to execute `configure' itself.

    This will configure the distribution to install the libraries,
    utilities, include and man files in '/usr/local/hdf/lib','/usr/local/hdf/bin',
    '/usr/local/hdf/include' and '/usr/local/hdf/man' respectively. The
    default 'prefix' is '/usr/local'. It is advisable to use something
    like the above to avoid overwriting say another 'libjpeg.a' that might be
    installed in '/usr/local/lib'. The '-v' option is for verbose output.

    If the configure script can't determine your type of computer, give it
    the name as an argument, for instance ``./configure sun4''.  You can
    use the script ``config.sub'' to test whether a name is recognized; if
    it is, config.sub translates it to a triplet specifying CPU, vendor,
    and OS.(e.g hppa1.1-hp-hpux9.03 for an HP900/735 running HPUX9.03).

    Compiling, Testing and Installing
    ---------------------------------
    To compile the library and utilities type:

        make 

    To find out the available make targets type:

        make help

    To test the libraries type :

        make test 

    It is a good idea to save the output of the tests and view it later for errors.
    e.g. 

        make test >& make.test.out

    To install the libraries, utilities, includes and man pages type: e.g.

        make install

Platform-specific Notes
========================
    HPUX(9.03) on PA-RISC
    ---------------------
    The distribution has been compilied/tested with both the native
    ANSI-C compilier and GCC 2.6.3. In both cases the native fortran
    compilier f77 was used. The binary distribution was compilied
    using the native compiliers.

    IRIX(5.2) on MIPS
    -----------------
    The distribution has been compilied/tested with the native
    ANSI-C compilier and the fortran compilier. There is 
    a ansi prototype clash with the XDR header files on this version 
    of the OS that as been fixed in IRIX 5.3. It is recommended the 
    OS be upgraded to IRIX 5.3. Due to the ansi prototype clash, 
    the netCDF xdr tests will not compile with the -ansi option. To get 
    around this you can compile this test using the -cckr option and 
    then compile/run the remainder of the tests using the regular
    -ansi option. Note that the library compilies fine but that the 
    xdr netCDF test does not without the above fix. The binary 
    distribution was compilied using the native compiliers.

    Solaris(2.3) on Sparc
    ---------------------
    The distribution has been compilied/tested with the native
    ANSI-C compilier and native fortran compilier. The binary 
    distribution was compilied using the native compiliers.

    Solaris(2.4) on INTEL(x86)
    ---------------------------
    The distribution has been compilied/tested with GCC 2.6.3 with
    NO fortran support. The binary distribution was compilied
    using GCC 2.6.3.


    Windows '95 or Windows NT
    -------------------------
    To install on a Windows '95 or Windows NT machine, read the seperate
    installation instructions for Windows NT:
      
        ./release_notes/install_winNT.txt.

Documentation
=============

    Manual pages for the library are not yet completed but some early
    drafts are available in ./man.

    The files in sub-directory ./release_notes are detailed descriptions
    for the new features. They can be used as  supplement documentation 
    for HDF4.0. Those files are also available on the NCSA ftp server, 
    in /HDF/Documentation/HDF4.0/4.0b2_release_notes/.


Installation Location
=====================

    By default, `make install' will install the HDF/netCDF files in
    `/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
    installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
    option `--prefix=PATH'. 

    eg.  ./configure -v --prefix=/usr/local/hdf

     This will configure the distribution to install the libraries,
     utilities, include and man files in '/usr/local/hdf/lib','/usr/local/hdf/bin',
     '/usr/local/hdf/include' and '/usr/local/hdf/man' respectively. The
     default 'prefix' is '/usr/local'. It is advisable to use something
     like the above to avoid overwriting say another 'libjpeg.a' that might be
     installed in '/usr/local/lib'.


Specifying the System Type
==========================

    There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
    automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host HDF/netCDF will run
    on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a
    message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
    `--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
    type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:

         CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

    e.g. hppa1.1-hp-hpux9.03

    See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.

    One system that requires this is the CM5. To configure properly
    for the parallel support on the CM5 you must type the following on the
    front end:

          ./configure -v CM5

Configure Options 
==================

Usage: configure [OPTIONS] [HOST]

Where HOST and TARGET are something like "sparc-sunos", "mips-sgi-irix5", etc.

    `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
    operates. 

NOTE: not all options are currently supported by this
      distribution.The following are the only ones supported.

    `--help'
         Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

     `--prefix=MYDIR`          install into MYDIR [/usr/local]
