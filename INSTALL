Requirements
============

    To build both HDF and netCDF library from sources, you need:

      * ANSI C compilier. The native ANSI compiliers on the above 
        platforms are supported. On platforms where no ANSI compilier
        was available the free GNU ANSI compilier GCC was used.

      * Fortran 77 compilier if you want fortran support. See above
        table for platforms where fortran is supported. You can
        compile 'libdf.a'(HDF library) without fortran support by using the
        make target 'allnofortran' e.g. 'make allnofortran'. If there is no
        fortran compilier the 'configure' script on the netCDF side of the  
        distribution(mfhdf) should detect that absence and configure the
        package accordingly. See below for further details of
        configuration and installation.
        

Configuration/Installation
===========================
        
    In this distribution there are two types of 'configure'
    scripts. One is the Cygnus 'configure' script and the other is the
    'configure' script created by the GNU autconf package. The Cygnus
    'configure' script is used at the top level to configure the overall
    distribution and the HDF library. The GNU 'configure' script is used by 
    the netCDF distribution to configure itself. 

    The Cygnus 'configure' script attempts to guess the correct
    platfrom you are configuring the distribution for by calling the shell
    script 'config.guess'. It outputs a unique string based on information
    obtained from the UNIX command 'uname' consisting of CPU-VENDOR-OS
    e.g. 'hppa1.1-hp-hpux9.03' for an  HP9000/735 running HPUX-9.03.

    The following shows the layout of the files used in the configuration.

    $(toplevel)/Makefile.in
                config.guess
                config.sub
                configure (cygnus)
                configure.in
                config/mh-hpux, mh-sun,.....
                      /custom_hpux, mh-sun,...

                mfhdf/CUSTOMIZE
                      configure(autconf)

                hdf/Makefile.in
                hdf/src/Makefile.in
                hdf/test/Makefile.in
                hdf/util/Makefile.in

                hdf/jpeg/configure.in
                hdf/jpeg/Makefile.in
                hdf/jpeg/configure.gnu
                hdf/jpeg/config/mh-hpux, mh-sun,...
                hdf/jpeg/config/jhpux.h, jsun.h,...

    To build both of the libraries contained in this directory,
    run the ``configure'' script int $(toplevel), e.g.:

	./configure -v --prefix=/usr/local/hdf

    If you're using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
    `sh ./configure -v --prefix=/usr/local/hdf' instead to prevent `csh' 
     from trying to execute `configure' itself.

    This will configure the distribution to install the libraries,
    utilities, include and man files in '/usr/local/hdf/lib','/usr/local/hdf/bin',
    '/usr/local/hdf/include' and '/usr/local/hdf/man' respectively. The
    default 'prefix' is '/usr/local'. It is advisable to use something
    like the above to avoid overwriting say another 'libjpeg.a' that might be
    installed in '/usr/local/lib'. The '-v' option is for verbose output.

    If the configure script can't determine your type of computer, give it
    the name as an argument, for instance ``./configure sun4''.  You can
    use the script ``config.sub'' to test whether a name is recognized; if
    it is, config.sub translates it to a triplet specifying CPU, vendor,
    and OS.(e.g hppa1.1-hp-hpux9.03 for an HP900/735 running HPUX9.03).

    To compile the library and utiltites type:

        ./make 

    To find out the available make targets type:

        ./make help

    To test the libraries type :

        ./make test 

    It is a good idea to save the output of the tests and view it later for errors.
    e.g. 

        ./make test >& make.test.out

    To install the libraries, utilities, includes and man pages type: e.g.

        ./make install


    To install on a Windows '95 or Windows NT machine, read the seperate
    installation instructions for Windows NT.

Documentation
=============

    Manual pages for the library are not yet completed but some early
    drafts are avaiable in XXX.

    Various formatted documents related to HDF can be obtained by ?


Installation Location
=====================

    By default, `make install' will install the HDF/netCDF files in
    `/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
    installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
    option `--prefix=PATH'. 

    eg.  ./configure -v --prefix=/usr/local/hdf

     This will configure the distribution to install the libraries,
     utilities, include and man files in '/usr/local/hdf/lib','/usr/local/hdf/bin',
     '/usr/local/hdf/include' and '/usr/local/hdf/man' respectively. The
     default 'prefix' is '/usr/local'. It is advisable to use something
     like the above to avoid overwriting say another 'libjpeg.a' that might be
     installed in '/usr/local/lib'.


Specifying the System Type
==========================

    There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
    automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host HDF/netCDF will run
    on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a
    message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
    `--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
    type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:

         CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

    e.g. hppa1.1-hp-hpux9.03

    See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.

    One system that requires this is the CM5. To configure properly
    for the parallel support on the CM5 you must type the following on the
    front end:

          ./configure -v CM5

Configure Options 
==================

Usage: configure [OPTIONS] [HOST]

Where HOST and TARGET are something like "sparc-sunos", "mips-sgi-irix5", etc.

    `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
    operates. 

NOTE: not all options are currently supported by this
      distribution.The following are the only ones supported.

    `--help'
         Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

     `--prefix=MYDIR`          install into MYDIR [/usr/local]
