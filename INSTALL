Requirements
============

    To build both HDF and netCDF library from sources, you need:

      * ANSI C compilier. The native ANSI compiliers on the above 
        platforms are supported. On platforms where no ANSI compilier
        was available the free GNU ANSI compilier GCC was used.

      * Fortran 77 compilier if you want fortran support. See above
        table for platforms where fortran is supported.
        

Configuration/Installation
===========================
        
    In this distribution there are two types of 'configure'
    scripts. One is the Cygnus 'configure' script and the other is the
    'configure' script created by the GNU autconf package. The Cygnus
    'configure' script is used at the top level to configure the overall
    distribution and the HDF library. The GNU 'configure' script is used by 
    the netCDF distribution to configure itself. 

    The Cygnus 'configure' script attempts to guess the correct
    platfrom you are configuring the distribution for by calling the shell
    script 'config.guess'. It outputs a unique string based on information
    obtained from the UNIX command 'uname' consisting of CPU-VENDOR-OS
    e.g. 'hppa1.1-hp-hpux9.03' from an  HP9000/735 running HPUX-9.03.


    To install on a Windows '95 or Windows NT machine, read the seperate
    installation instructions for Windows NT.

Compilers and Options
=====================



Installation Names
==================

    By default, `make install' will install the HDF/netCDF files in
    `/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
    installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
    option `--prefix=PATH'.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

    There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
    automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host HDF/netCDF will run
    on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a
    message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
    `--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
    type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:

         CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

    See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.

Operation Controls
==================

    `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
    operates. 

NOTE: not all options are currently supported by this
      distribution.

    `--help'
         Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.
