             the multi_file annotation interface, the multi_file raster
             image interface, HDF command line utilities (hdp, the hdf 
             dumper is in mfhdf/), 
             and a test suite. It also contains the software
             distributions for JPEG(hdf/jpeg) and ZLIB(hdf/zlib) 
             which are required by the HDF library. 
             Please see the README in each directory for further info

   man    -- incomplete set of man page(s) for HDF.

   release_notes -- descriptions on new features and bug fixes in this
                    release. Files in this sub-directory can be used 
                    as supplemental documentation for HDF. These files 
                    are also available on the THG ftp server, 
                    in /HDF/HDF_Current/release_notes/.

Third Party Software Requirements:
---------------------------------
 1. JPEG distribution release 6b(libjpeg.a). The "official" site 
    for this is ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz


 2. ZLIB 1.1.4(libz.a) or later  distribution.  

System Requirements
-------------------
 To build the HDF library from source, you need:

   * an ANSI C compiler. The native ANSI compilers on the above 
     platforms are supported. On platforms where no ANSI compiler
     was available the free GNU ANSI compiler GCC was used.

------------------------------
 See the INSTALL file for instructions on configuring,
 testing and installing for Unix and non-UNIX systems.
