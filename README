               README for HDF/netCDF 4.0 Distribution
               --------------------------------------

Obtaining the latest version
----------------------------
    The most recent version of the distribution can be obtained from
the NCSA ftp archive site at:

     ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF4.0r1

Distribution Layout
-------------------
There are five subdirectories in this directory:

config -- contains machine dependent makefile fragments(mh-<os>). 
hdf    -- contains the source code for the HDF 'base library', the 
          the multi_file annotation interface, the multi_file raster
          image interface, HDF command line utilities (hdp, an hdf 
          dumper is in mfhdf/), Pablo instrumentation support, 
          and a test suite.
mfhdf  -- contains the netCDF/HDF part of HDF.
man    -- man page(s) for HDF.
release_notes -- descriptions on new features and bug fixes in this
                 release. Files in this sub-directory can be used 
                 as  supplement documentation for HDF4.0. These files 
                 are also available on the NCSA ftp server, 
                 in /HDF/Documentation/HDF4.0/release_notes/.

Configuring/Testing/Installing for UNIX systems(Short version)
-------------------------------------------------------------
It is now possible to automatically configure and build both the
HDF and netCDF distributions with one command. The following is a
quick intro to configuring, testing and installing this distribution.
If you have problems see the INSTALL file for detail instructions.

To build both of the distributions contained in this directory,
run the ``configure'' script here, e.g.:

	./configure -v --prefix=/usr/local/hdf

This will configure the distribution to install the libraries,
utilities, include and man files in '/usr/local/hdf/lib',
'/usr/local/hdf/bin', '/usr/local/hdf/include' and 
'/usr/local/hdf/man' respectively. The default 'prefix' is 
'/usr/local'. It is advisable to use something like the above 
to avoid overwriting say another 'libjpeg.a' that might be
installed in '/usr/local/lib'. The '-v' option is for verbose 
output.

If the configure script can't determine your type of computer
then it probably is a platfrom that is no longer supported.
If you want to be adventurous see the section 'Dealing with
Configure Problems' in the INSTALL file. Otherwise send an 
email to 'hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu' for further help. 

`configure' is a Bourne-shell (`/bin/sh') script; if your system
does not recognize this automatically when you run a different 
shell, you may need to run `sh' on it explicitly:

        sh ./configure -v --prefix=/usr/local/hdf

To compile the library and utiltites type:

        make 

To find out the available make targets type:

        make help

To test the libraries and utilities type:

        make test 

It is a good idea to save the output of the tests and view it 
later for errors.e.g. 

        make test >& make.test.out

To install the libraries, utilities, includes and man pages type: e.g.

        make install

See the INSTALL file for detail instructions on configuring and 
installation and for non-UNIX systems.


DOCUMENTATION/FAQ/HELP
----------------------

The HDF 4.0 documentation can be found on the NCSA ftp server
in the directory /HDF/Documentation/HDF4.0/Users_Guide.  The
HDF home page is at:

      http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/

An FAQ is available on our ftp server, as well as under
"Information about HDF" in the home page.
