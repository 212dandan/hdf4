For general information about the Java HDF Products, please
read the README file and the Java HDF Web Pages,
   http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/java-hdf-html/

1) Ensure JDK 1.1.x is Installed if Necessary
   The bundled version of the JHV includes the Java Runtime 
   Environment (JRE), which will run without any additional
   software.

   The ready-to-run version of the JHV requires JDK 1.1.6 or 
   equivalent.  The many be optained from: 
       http://www.javasoft.com/products/JDK/index.html

2)  Unpacke the Distribution

   The JHV 2.2 is distributed in a single ZIP file.  The fies 
   should be extracted into a directory, the "JHV home directory".

3) The Installed Files
   The JHV home directory contains the pre-compiled binary 
   distribution for the HDF Java Products, compiled on a 
   Windows 95 running Windows 95/NT.  It includes the full 
   HDF 4.1r2 library for Windows 95/NT.

   The JHV directory is organized as follows:

     bin/
        jhv.bat         - The batch file to run the JHV.
                          You may need to modify this file to set
                          JAVAHOME and JHVHOME
     docs/
        UsersGuide      - The JHV User's Guide

     lib/
        jhv.props       - The JHV property file,
                          You may need to eidt this file to change default properties
                          e.g. jhv.guide=file:///C|/jhv/docs/UserGuide/jhv2.2/index.html
        classes.zip     - File containing all of the Java classes  
                          used by the Java Products
        hdficons/       - Directory containing GIF files used by JHV
        win95/hdf.dll   - HDF 4.1r2 library and Java wrapper C code
                          for Windows 95/NT      

     samples/           - Sample HDF files to use with JHV

     Jre/               - The Java Runtime Environment, for JRE version only

4) To Set Up and Run the JHV Program
    The following steps are required to run JHV on a Windows 95/NT system: 
        1.Set the variable JHVHOME in the JHV batch file jhv.bat (in your_jhv_home\bin). The default JHVHOME is "..". If you run JHV from a directory other than your_JHV_home/bin, you need to set your JHVHOME. e.g. "SET JHVHOME=C:\JHV". 
        2.If needed, set the variable JAVAHOME. JAVAHOME is not needed for the JRE version. 
        3.Create a shortcut to the JHV executable, if desired. 
        4.Start JHV by double-clicking on the executable icon or on the shortcut, or by typing jhv at
          the DOS command prompt. 
     If you get the error message "Out of environment space" when running jhv.bat under Windows
     95, you need to set the Initial Environment memory allocated to the command line to 4096 bytes
     as follows: 
        1.Open the Windows Explorer. 
        2.Open the JHV home directory. 
        3.Open the bin directory. 
        4.Right click on the jhv.bat icon. 
        5.Select Properties from the menu. 
        6.Click the Memory tab. 
        7.Find Initial Environment. 
        8.Click the arrow next to the field. 
        9.Scroll to and select 4096. 
       10.Click OK .
