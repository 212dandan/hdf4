<H1> Chapter 9: Spreadsheets and Plots </H1>
A JHV spreadsheet is designed to display the raw data of an image or a 
Vdata table.  The spreadsheet displays data that can be defined in terms of 
three variables: <i>two independent variables which correspond to the row 
and column labels, and a dependent variable, which has a value at every 
point.</i>  JHV supports two types of spreadsheet: image spreadsheets and 
Vdata spreadsheets.  An image spreadsheet is created from an image which 
represents an HDF raster image or an SDS data array.  A Vdata spreadsheet 
is a table which displays a Vdata.

<h2>9.1 Image Spreadsheets</h2>
<p>JHV has the ability to generate a spreadsheet from an image. Select a 
subset area from the image in the image window and click the spreadsheet 
button to create a spreadsheet containing the data of the selected 
image area.

<P> 
The current image spreadsheet supports a <b>Make Image</b> action. 
<b>Make Image</b> creates an image from the spreadsheet. There are two 
parameters associated with creating an image from a spreadsheet: 
an expansion factor and interpolation.

<DL>
  <DT><b>Expansion factor </b>
  <DD>The expansion factor determines the magnification of the image created 
      from the spreadsheet.  The factor values are integers such as 1, 2, 3, 
      and so on. An image with expansion factor 1 is the same size as the 
      original selected image area.  An image with expansion factor 2 will be 
      double the original image size, and so forth. Larger expansion factors 
      will produce lower resolution images with a jagged appearance.
  <p>
  <DT><b>Interpolation </b>
  <DD>The interpolation option attempts to choose color values that better 
      preserve the quality and detail in the original image. Interpolation is 
      very useful when you create an image with a larger expansion factor. 
      A large expansion factor with no imterpolation will yield a jagged 
      appearance because the resolution does not increase with the magnification 
      of the image.  Interpolation produces an image with the resolution of 
      the original image even for larger expansion factors.  In the following 
      figure, two images have been created from the same spreadsheet with 
      expansion factor 10. The left image, with a jagged appearance, was 
      created without interpolation. The image on the right, with a smoother 
      appearance, was created with interpolation.

<h2>9.2 Vdata Spreadsheets</h2>
A Vdata object is a table in which each row has the same structure and 
each column contains data of the same data type.  A column can be any of 
data type, such as character, integer, floating point, or an array of 
these types.  Therefore, a cell in a Vdata table can be an array.  
Elements may be cut off in display if a cell is an array. 
<p>
To open a Vdata spreadsheet, click on a Vdata object icon in the 
HDF hierarchical tree in the main window.  The spreadsheet will appear 
in a spreadsheet window.
<p>
The spreadsheet window <b>File</b> menu offers three commands: 
<dl>
<dt><b>Save AS HDF</b>
  <dd>Saves the current Vdata into a new HDF file. 
<dt><b>Save AS Text</b>
  <dd>Saves the Vdata into a new ASCII file.
<dt><b>Close</b>
  <dd>Closes the spreadsheet window. 
</dl>

<h2>9.3 Vdata X-Y Plots</h2>
Clicking on a column with numeric data in a Vdata spreadsheet opens a 
plot window with the column values plotted against the row index numbers. 
Clicking on another column adds that column to the plot.  The Vdata 
spreadsheet cannot create plots for columns containing arrays or 
character data.  
<p>The following is an example of Vdata plot with two columns (Integer 
and Float) plotted against the row index.
<p>

<P>The Vdata plot window offers three menus:

<DL>
  <DT><b>Option menu</b>
  <DD>
    <TABLE border="1" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">
      <TR><TD>Line-Plot
      <BR>XY-Plot
    </TABLE>
  <p>
  The <b>Option</b> menu contains two commands: 
  <b>Line-Plot</b> and <b>XY-Plot</b>. A line-plot is a 
  2D plot in which columns (vertical axis) are plotted against 
  the row index (horizontal axis). An X-Y plot is a plot in 
  which columns are plotted against the first selected column.

  <p>
  <DT><b>View menu</b>
  <DD>
    <TABLE border="1" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">
      <TR><TD>Zoom In
      <BR>Zoom Out
    </TABLE>
  <p>
  The <b>View</b> menu provides zooming in and zooming out functions. 
  <b>Zoom In</b> decreases the range of visible rows in the plot;
  <b>Zoom Out</b> increases the visible range.

  <p>
  <DT><b>Style menu</b>
  <DD>
    <TABLE border="1" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">
      <TR><TD>Line
      <BR>Scatter
    </TABLE>
  <p>
  The <b>Line</b> style provides a line plot.  With the <b>Scatter</b> 
  style, column values are scattered on the plot.
