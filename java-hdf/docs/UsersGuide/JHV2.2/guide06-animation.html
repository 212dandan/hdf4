<H1> Chapter 7: Animation </H1>
JHV presents 3D images as a series of 2D cross-sectional slices cut 
along a user-selected axis.  The animation tools enable you to view the 
3D image by playing the sequence of 2D images as an animation.

<h2>7.1 Opening the Animation Window </h2>
<P>Animations can be prepared from two types of data sets:
<ul>
<li>Sets of sequential, 8-bit, 2D raster images
<li>3D SDS arrays
</ul>

<DL>
  <DT><b>8-bit raster images</b>
  <DD>To display 8-bit raster images in animation, first set <b>Animation</b> 
      from the main window <b>View</b> menu, then click on a folder containing 
      a set of 8-bit raster images.  The animation window will appear, with the 
      animation panel on the left and a control panel on the right.

  <DT><b>3D SDS arrays</b>
  <DD>A 3D SDS array is presented by first <em>slicing</em> the data set  
      along a user-selected axis.  Each slice is viewed as a separate 
      2D image and the sequence of slices represents the full 3D image.

      </center>
      <p>
      When you first select a 3D SDS, JHV will present a slice-selection window.
      Choose the X-, Y-, or Z-axis.  The <b>Slice Selection</b> field to the
      right of the <b>X Slice</b> button will state how many slices will be
      created; the text window displays the number of the current slice, which
      is displayed in the image preview panel.  You can select a slice with the 
      slidebar or by typing a valid entry, a number within the range specified
      in the <b>Slice Selection</b> field, in the text window.
<p>
<B>Warning:</b>  <i>The user should be aware that animation through the array in any order other than the natural storage order will be slower, possibly 
very much lower.</i>
      <p>
      Click on the preview image to open the image window.  Click on the 
      image window <b>Animation</b> button to open the animation window 
      illustrated in Figure 7.1.

<h2>7.2 Animation Options and Color Management</h2>
JHV provides several tools for structuring and manipulating animations.  
These are controlled through the image selection window, buttons, 
slidebars, and a pull-down menu inthe right half the animation window:
<dl>
  <dt>Image selection window
    <dd>Click on individual images, or slices, to select them for the 
        animation.
    <br>
  <dt><b>Select All</b>
    <dd>Selects all elements listed in the image selection window.
    <br>
  <dt><b>Unselect All</b>
    <dd>Deletes all elements listed in the image selection window from the 
        animation list.
    <br>
  <dt><b>Forward</b> and <b>Backward</b>
    <dd>These buttons play the animation forward or backward.
    <br>
  <dt><b>Next</b> and <b>Previous</b>
    <dd>These buttons display the next or previous image in the 
        animation sequence.
    <br>
  <dt><b>Stop</b>
    <dd>Stops the animation.
    <br>
  <dt><b>Dismiss</b>
    <dd>Closes the animation window.
    <br>
  <dt><b>Frame(s):</b> (a slidebar)
    <dd>Displays the selected image in the sequence.
    <br>
  <dt><b>Speed (ms):</b> (a slidebar)
    <dd>Sets the speed at which the animation is played.
    <br>
  <dt><b>Loop</b>, <b>Single</b>, and <b>Bounce</b> (in a pull-down menu 
      at the bottom of the window)
    <dd>Sets the type of animation to be played.  
        <br>
        <b>Loop</b> plays the animation in a repeating loop, always 
        running in the same direction.  
        <br>
        <b>Bounce</b> plays the animation repeatedly, but changing 
        direction each time it is played -- forward once, then backward, 
        then forward, etc.
        <br>
        <b>Single</b> plays the animation one time.  
</dl>

<p>
There are also two buttons for accessing the JHV color management tools:
<dl>
  <dt><b>Edit Palette</b>
    <dd>Opens the palette editor.
    <br>
  <dt><b>Update Palette</b>
    <dd>Updates the images with the new palette from the palette editor.  
        (Performs the same action as <b>Set Palette</b> on the image 
        window <b>Palette</b> menu.)
</dl>
