<H1> Chapter 8: Image Overlays </H1>
Image overlays often facilitate the interpretation and analysis of 
closely-related images.  JHV supports image overlays for 8-bit raster images, 
allowing the user to select a base image, overlay that with one or more images, 
and adjust transparency and opacity to optimize the resulting composite image.

The discussion in this chapter uses the sample file 
<code>samples/layers8bit.hdf</code> located in the JHV installation directory.

<h2>8.1 Opening the Image Overlay Window </h2>
To start overlaying images, first set <b>Layer</b> in the main window
<b>View</b> menu, then select a folder with multiple 8-bit raster images,
such as the folder <code>8-bit Raster Image</code> in the file 
<code>samples/layers8bit.hdf</code>.  The image overlay window will appear, 
with the overlay panel on the left and a control panel on the right.

<h2>8.2 Overlay Options </h2>
<P>JHV provides options to choose the base layer and top layer image(s), 
to render a selected background color transparent, and to adjust image 
opacity.

<DL>

  <DT><b>Image List</b>
  <DD>Image layers are selected from the image list at the top of the control 
      panel.  The images are laid down in the order of selection: the first image 
      selected will be placed at the bottom as the base layer, or base image; 
      other images will be laid one over another in sequential order; the last
      image selected will be the top image in the overlaid stack.  
      Figure 8.1 illustrates a high and low air pressure map (image #2 in 
      the <code>8-bit Raster Image</code> folder in <code>layers8bit.hdf</code>) 
      overlaid on a United States map (image #0 in the same folder and file).
      <p>
  <DT><b>Transparency</b>
  <DD>Image overlays require that all images above the base image have a 
      transparent background. Any upper image lacking transparency will 
      obscure the images below it in the overlay.  
      <p>
      To make an image transparent, select the image from the image list 
      and click on the image to select the background color to be rendered 
      transparent; the selected background color will appear in the 
      <b>Background</b> panel.  Upon pressing the <b>Apply</b> button, the
      selected background will become transparent and lower images in the 
      stack will become visible.  
      <p>
      In Figure 8.2, the left side illsutrates the high and low air pressure 
      map (image #2) with white background overlaid on the United States map 
      (image #0).  Since the pressure map's white background has not yet been 
      made transparent, it still obscures the U.S. map.  The right side of the 
      figure illustrates the same image layers, but after rendering the 
      pressure map's white background transparent.

  <P>
  <DT><B>Opacity</B>
  <DD>In many cases, the non-transparent portions of two or more images may 
      overlap.  JHV provides a tool for adjusting the upper image's opacity
      so that overlapping details are all visible.
      <p>
      Slide the opacity slidebar, labeled <b>Opaque</b> in the image overlay 
      window control panel, and press <b>Apply</b> to change the opacity of 
      an image.  You can repeat the process to fine-tune the opacity.  
      An image layer with 0% opacity is completely transparent, while a layer 
      with 100% opacity is completely opaque.  Opacity can be set independently
      for each layer.
      <p>
      Figure 8.3 illustrates a cloud cover image (image #4 in the above folder 
      and file) overlaid on the U.S. map (image #0) with 50% opacity.
