<H1> Chapter 3: Opening HDF Data Objects </H1>
HDF is a library and platform independent data format for the storage and 
exchange of scientific data.  HDF files may contain many types of information 
that a scientist might need.  
<p>
JHV can be used to view several types of HDF data objects.  Due the differing 
natures of these types of data sets, the manner in which they open for display
differs from one type to another.  For example, an 8-bit raster image will open 
a preview copy of the image, a 3D SDS first asks how the data is to be sliced for 
viewing, and a Vdata opens as a data table.  This chapter describes opening each
of the data types in a JHV session.
<P>
Currently JHV can be used with five types of HDF objects:
<DL>
  <DT><A HREF="#guide02-annotation"> 3.1 File and Data Object Annotations</A> 
  <DT><A HREF="#guide02-ri"> 3.2 Raster Images</A> 
  <DT><A HREF="#guide02-sds"> 3.3 Scientific Data Sets</A> 
  <DT><A HREF="#guide02-vdata"> 3.4 Vdatas, ot Tables</A> 
  <DT><A HREF="#guide02-vgroup"> 3.5 Vgroups</A> 
</DL> 
<p>
The last four types of data above are the essential data sets; HDF was 
created to store these types of information in a widely-accessible format.
Annotations, the first item, are a fundamentally different sort of data; they 
exist solely to describe the data stored in the HDF file.
<p>
Complete information regarding these data structures is available from 
<A HREF=http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/>The HDF Home Page.</A>

<A NAME="guide02-annotation"</A>
<H2>3.1 File and Data Object Annotations</H2>
HDF annotations are text strings used to describe a file or any of the 
data elements the HDF file contains. 
<p>
Annotations come in two forms; labels and descriptions. 
<em>Labels</em> are short annotations used for assigning things like titles 
or time stamps to a file or its data objects.  <em>Descriptions</em> are 
longer annotations; they typically contain more extensive information, such 
as a source code module or mathematical formulae. 
<p>
There are also two types of annotations:  file annotations and data object
annotations.  A <em>file annotation</em> describes an entire HDF file.
A <em>data object annotation</em> describes a particular data object within
the file.
<p>File and data object annotations can each be either labels or descriptions.  
Thus an annotation might be a file label, a file description, an object label, 
or an object description.

<A NAME="guide02-ri"</A>
<H2>3.2 Raster Images</H2>
<p>The <em>general raster</em>, or <em>GR</em>, data model is designed to 
provide a flexible means of storing raster image data, including 8-bit raster 
or 24-bit raster images.  Raster image data is stored in a two-dimensional 
array and attributes may be associated with the image, the file, or both. 
Palettes (also known as CLUTs or color look-up tables) and compression method 
information can also be associated with an image.
<p>
For backward compatibility, the HDF library allows users to access images as 
a generic raster image or as an 8-bit or 24-bit raster image. In such a case, 
the image is stored once, but under two identities; JHV will show two objects 
in the hierarchy, although there is really only one image in the file.

<DL>
  <DT><b>GR object annotation</b>
  <DD>A GR object annotation contains information about the image. 
      The information can be displayed in the text area by clicking the object 
      folder. The following is an example of a GR object annotation.
  <p>
  <TABLE width = 360 BORDER=0 bgcolor="#FFF999" cols=1 cellspacing=0 >
  <tr><TD width = 360 bgcolor="#FFF999">
  <pre> 
  Image Name : Raster Image #1
  Image Index: 1

  Num of Attributes: 0
  </pre>
  </td></tr> 
  </TABLE><p>

  <DT><B>GR data attributes</B>
  <DD>Attributes are defined by the calling program to contain auxiliary 
      information about a file, an image, or both. Click the attribute 
      object icon in the hierarchical tree to view the data attributes. 
      The data attributes are displayed in Name/Value format in the message 
      window.

  <DT><b>GR preview image</b> 
  <DD>JHV has a limited image display capability.  When you select an image, 
      JHV will first present a compressed preview of the image in the fixed-size
      preview image window.  You can then select subsamples of the image for 
      further display.  Note that the entire image is displayed in the preview
      window when the image is the same size or smaller than the window.
  <p>To examine a portion of the image at greater resolution (up to the 
     resolution of the original image), drag the mouse on the preview image to 
     select a subsample or click on the image to select the full image. 
     The selected subsample will be displayed in a separate image window.

<A NAME="guide02-sds"</A>
<H2>3.3 Scientific Data Set</H2>
The <em>scientific data set</em> model, or <em>SDS</em>, supports four 
primary data objects: arrays, dimensions, dimension scales, and dimension 
attributes. The fundamental object of the model is the SDS array; the 
remaining objects describe the array.
<p>
JHV can display 2- or 3-dimensional SDS arrays. A 2D array is displayed 
as a single image; a 3D array is displayed as an animated sequence of 
2D images sliced along the third axis.  
See <a href="guide06-animation.html">Chapter 7, Animations</A>, for 
further information.

<DL>

  <DT><B>SDS object information</B>
  <DD>SDS object information is a description of the SDS object data. Click the SDS object folder to view the object information. Below is an example of SDS object information.
  <p>
  <TABLE width = 360 BORDER=0 bgcolor="#FFF999" cols=1 cellspacing=0 >
  <tr><TD width = 360 bgcolor="#FFF999">

  Number of Attributes : 6
  </pre>
  </td></tr> 
  </TABLE>

  <P>
  <DT><B>SDS data attributes</B>
  <DD>Attributes describe the nature and/or intended usage of the object 
      they are attached to.  The object may be a file, an SDS, or a dimension.
      JHV displays the data attributes in Name/Value format in the message window.

  <DT><B>SDS preview image</B> 
  <DD>An SDS preview image is a compressed image created from SDS array. 
      <p>
      A 2D SDS array is displayed as a 2D image in the preview image panel. 
      <p>
      A 3D SDS array is displayed as a sequence of 2D images; each 2D image 
      is a slice of the 3D image taken along an axis selected by the user.
      These 2D images can be viewed singly or as an animated sequence.
      See <a href="guide06-animation.html">Chapter 7, Animations</A>, for 
      further information.

<A NAME="guide02-vdata"</A>
<H2>3.4 Vdatas, or Tables</H2>
An HDF Vdata object is a collection of records whose values are stored in 
fixed-length fields. Thus, a vdata is like a table in which each row has the 
same structure and each column contains data of the same type. The Vdata 
model allows multiple entries per field; the number of entries or components 
in a field is called the <em>order</em> of the field. 

<DL>
  <DT><B>Vdata information</b>
  <DD>Information regarding a vdata object includes record number, field name, 
      field order, field type, and so forth. This information is displayed in 
      the JHV message window when you click on the vdata object folder. The 
      following is an example of such vdata information:
  <P>
  <TABLE width = 300 BORDER=0 bgcolor="#FFF999" cols=1 cellspacing=0 >
  <tr><TD width = 300 bgcolor="#FFF999">

  DSPLAT         1              64-bit floating point
  DSPLON         1              64-bit floating point
  DELTAX         1              32-bit floating point
  DELTAY         1              32-bit floating point
  ROTANGLE       1              32-bit floating point
  MATCH          1              8-bit unsigned integer
  </pre>
  </td></tr>
  </TABLE>

  <P>
  <DT><b>Vdata table</b>
  <DD>JHV displays a Vdata table as a 
      <a href="guide08-spreadsheet.html">spreadsheet</a> with columns 
      and rows representing the Vdata fields and records respectively. 
      The JHV spreadsheet functionality is somewhat limited, 
      supporting only plot and save functions.

<A NAME="guide02-vgroup"</A>
<H2>3.5 Vgroups</H2>
An HDF vgroup object is a structure designed to associate related objects.  
The general structure of Vgroups is similar to the Unix file system of 
directories, subdirectories, and files in that a Vgroup may contain 
references to other Vgroups and/or to data objects.  Any HDF object can 
be included within a Vgroup.
<p>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="images/vgroup.gif">

</CENTER>

<DL>

  <DT><b>Vgroup information</b>
  <DD>Vgroup information is displayed by clicking on a Vgroup folder in 
      the displayed file hierarchy. The following example shows that the 
      current HDF file contains two Vgroups, 
      <code>AVHRR 1KM Global 10 day Composite</code> and 
      <code>avhrr-ndvi-060192.hdf</code>.

  Class Name: CDF0.0
  Entries: 5
  </pre>
  </td></tr>  
  </TABLE>
  
  <P>
  <DT><b>Vgroup data</b>
  <DD>A Vgroup data object is usually a Vdata or an SDS data set. 
      Clicking on a Vgroup object node opens the Vgroup object in
      the appropriate <A HREF=#guide02-vdata>vdata</a> or 
      <A HREF=#guide02-sds>sds</a> mode.
