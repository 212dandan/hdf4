<A NAME="guide00-overview"</A>
<H2>1.1 Overview</H2>
<p>
The Java&#8482; HDF Viewer (JHV) is a Java-based visualization tool for 
browsing NCSA Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) files. 
JHV allows users to browse through any HDF file; 
starting with a view of all top-level objects in an HDF file's hierarchy, 
JHV allows a user to descend through the hierarchy and navigate among the
file's data objects. 
The content of a data object is loaded only when the object is selected,
providing interactive and efficient access to HDF files.
<p>
The JHV user interface is designed to be easy to use and intuitive. 
JHV was implemented by using Java that is designed to be machine-independent. 
The interface and features are the same for all platforms. 
The structure of the HDF file is displayed in a tree with data groups and 
data objects represented as conventional folders and icons. 
You can easily expand or collapse folders to navigate the 
hierarchical structure of an HDF file.

<A NAME="guide00-features"</A>
<H2>1.2 JHV Features</H2>
JHV version 2.2 has the following features. Limitations on these features are listed in the next section. 

<ul>
  <LI> Loads HDF and ASCII files.
  <LI> Converts an ASCII file into an HDF file.
  <LI> Saves a data object into an HDF file or an ASCII file.
  <LI> Supports viewing scientific data sets (multidimensional arrays), 
       Vdata tables (record or tabular data tables), raster images, 
       palettes, attributes (text or numeric descriptions of a dataset 
       or macros), Vgroups (hierarchical grouping of data objects in 
       the file) and file annotations (text descriptions of a file).
  <LI> Lets users descend levels of each kind of HDF object and displays 
       information about objects, such as the dimensions of an SDS, 
       the names and values of its attributes, etc.
  <LI> Allows mouse-drag to select and display a subset of an SDS array 
       or raster image.
  <LI> Magnifies the display of a selected rectangular sub-region of an 
       image by a zoom factor.
  <LI> Displays the image pixel coordinates, dimensional scales, and 
       data/pixel values continuously as the mouse moves.
  <LI> Generates spreadsheet data from images or creates an image from 
       spreadsheet data.
  <LI> Does animations for 3D SDS or multiple 8-bit raster images.
  <LI> Makes transparent images and overlays 8-bit raster images.
  <LI> Changes an image palette and performs image manipulation such as 
       RGB color balance, contrast, smooth, image contour, etc.
  <LI> Creates XY-plots and histograms from images.
  <LI> Plots data columns from a Vdata table with different view options 
       and display styles.
  <LI> Shows data statistics and converts data with the general power 
       function, f(x) = Constant + Slope * x^Power.
  <LI> Shows data attributes in (name, value) table format.
  <LI> Opens the Online User's Guide.

</ul>

<A NAME="guide00-limitations"</A>
<H2>1.3 Limitations</H2>
<p>
The current implementation of JHV has the following limitations. 
Many of these limitations are scheduled for resolution in the 
next JHV release, currently targeted for October 1998.
<ul>
  <LI> Remote file access is not supported.
  <LI> JHV only loads/saves ASCII files which follow the 
       <a href=guide10-ascii2hdf.html>HDF ASCII Interchange Format</a>. 
  <LI> Loading a large ASCII file is very slow.
  <LI> Only one object (or subset) may be savesd to a file, <i>i.e.</i>, saving multiple objects
is not supported.
  <LI> Updating or appending to an existing file is not supported.
  <LI> Saving an ASCII file does not save a color table for a raster image,  
       or dimension scales for an SDS.
  <LI> JHV only supports 2- or 3-dimensional SDSs.  1D SDSs cannot be 
viewed.
  <LI> Opening a large image or data object may not work due to the 
       limitations of the Java virtual machine.
  <LI> Vdata fields with order 3 or above may be cut off in display.
  <LI> Copying and pasting image or spreadsheet data are not supported.
  <LI> Image overlay of planes of a 3D SDS is not supported.
</ul>

<A NAME="guide00-requirements"</A>
<H2>1.4 System Requirements</H2>
To run JHV, a Java 1.1.x Virtual Machine, such as JDK-1.1.6, is required 
and 24MB RAM is recommended.  JHV version 2.2 has been built and is 
available on the following platforms:
  <ul>
      <li>Solaris 
      <li>Solaris-x86 
      <li>SGI IRIX 5.3 
      <li>SGI IRIX 6.2 
      <li>Linux 
      <li>Windows 95/NT 
  </ul>

<A NAME="guide00-installation"</A>
<H2>1.5 Installing and Running JHV</H2>
JHV is distributed from the 
<a href=http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/java-hdf-html/>NCSA Java-based Products</a> 
page at <code>http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/java-hdf-html/</code>. 
<p>
The JHV distribution is available in two forms:
<ol>
<li>
A self-contained package, complete with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).  
This package can be installed and run with no other software.  (About 18 MB)
<li>
A ready-to-run Java application, which can run on any system which
has Java installed.  (About 3 MB)
</ol>

<ul>
<li>For UNIX systems, download and execute the self-installation shell program.
<li>For Windows 95/NT systems, download and execute the self-extracting archive.
</ul>
In both cases, this step will install a JHV directory structure on your system.  
The README file in the top level of that structure contains the following 
instrctions for running JHV.

<p>
For the self-contained package, this is all than is needed.
For the ready-to-run package, the Java environment needs to be set up:
<DL>

<DT><b>UNIX environment</b>
<DD>
To run JHV on a UNIX system, first set the following environment variables:
  <OL>
    <li><code>CLASSPATH</code> -- add the path to the NCSA JHI/JHV classes, <br>
        e.g. <code>setenv CLASSPATH /usr/local/jhv/lib/classes.zip:$CLASSPATH</code>
    <li><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> -- add the path to the NCSA JHI/JHV libraries, <br>
        e.g. <code>setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/jhv/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
    <li><code>PATH</code> -- add the path to the NCSA JHI/JHV binaries, <br>
        e.g. <code>setenv PATH /usr/local/jhv/bin:$PATH</code>
  </OL>
<dd>
Then start JHV by typing <code>jhv</code> at a command line prompt.

<p>
<DT><b>Windows 95/NT environment</b>
<DD>
The following steps are required to run JHV on a Windows 95/NT system:
<ol>
<li>Set the variable JHVHOME in the JHV batch file <code>jhv.bat</code> 
    (in <code>your_jhv_home\bin</code>). 
<li>If needed, set the variable JAVAHOME. 
<li>Create a shortcut to the JHV executable, if desired. 
<li>Start JHV by double-clicking on the executable icon or on the shortcut, 
    or by typing <code>jhv</code> at the DOS command prompt.
</ol>
<dd>If you get the error message "Out of environment space" when running 
<code>jhv.bat</code> under Windows 95, you need to set the 
<i>Initial Environment</i> memory allocated to the command line to 4096 bytes
as follows:
<OL>
    <LI> Open the Windows Explorer.
    <LI> Open the JHV home directory.
    <LI> Open the <code>bin</code> directory.
    <LI> Right click on the <code>jhv.bat</code> icon.
    <LI> Select <b>Properties</b> from the menu.
    <LI> Click the <b>Memory</b> tab.
    <LI> Find <b>Initial Environment</b>.
    <LI> Click the arrow next to the field.
    <LI> Scroll to and select 4096.
    <LI> Click OK .
</OL>
