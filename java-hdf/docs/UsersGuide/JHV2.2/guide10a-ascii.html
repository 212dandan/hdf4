<H1> Chapter 11: Using ASCII HDF Files, or Text Files</H1>
In addition to standard HDF files, JHV also reads and writes ASCII files 
that adhere to the <a href=guide10-ascii2hdf.html>HDF ASCII Interchange 
Format</a>, HAIF.  Such ASCII files are often useful when exchanging data
with non-HDF applications.

<h2>11.1 Reading, Writing, and Working with ASCII Files</h2>
JHV reads and works with HAIF-compliant ASCII files transparently; as an 
enduser, you do not need to know whether a file is a standard HDF file or an 
HAIF-compliant ASCII file.  
<p>
Like any HDF file, an HAIF-compliant ASCII file may contain multiple data 
objects.  The headers of these objects are read and grouped into a 
hierarchical tree, and the content of a data object is not loaded until it 
is selected. 
<p>
Writing ASCII files is nearly transparent; the only distinct action required 
is to select <b>Save as HDF</b> or <b>Save As Text</b> from the image window 
<b>File</b> menu.
<p>
JHV saves data to both ASCII and HDF files and converts an ASCII file to 
an HDF file.  The data structure of the ASCII file is preserved in the HDF 
file and the content of each data object is stored in the HDF file based on 
its type.  Each data object or subset of a data object can be also saved as 
an ASCII or HDF file. 
<p>
Saving data in ASCII files allows for export to other programs. 
For instance, an HDF Vdata table saved in ASCII format can be opened by 
Microsoft Excel.

<H2>11.2 Converting an ASCII File to an HDF File</H2>
To convert an HAIF-compliant ASCII file to a standard HDF file, all you need 
to do is read the ASCII file and write an HDF file.
<p>
Select <b>Open Local File</b> from the <b>File</b> menu and open an ASCII 
file that complies with the specifications of the 
<a href="guide10-ascii2hdf.html">HDF ASCII Interchange Format</a>. 
After the text file has been loaded, select <b>Convert To HDF File</b> from 
the main window <b>File</b> menu to create an HDF file.  The data structure 
of the ASCII file will be preserved in the HDF file and the content of each 
data object will be stored in the HDF file based on its original type. 
<p>
<b>Convert To HDF File</b> is disabled when the current working file is 
an HDF file.
