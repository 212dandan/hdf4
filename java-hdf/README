1.  Contents of this release
    ========================

This package contains the complete Java interface for the
HDF 4.1r2 library, and the Java HDF Viewer application.

  Java HDF Interface (JHI) :

       The Java interface for HDF consists of two parts:
            1. Java classes to interface, including 'native methods'
               and support for Java Exceptions, and data conversion.
            2. C-library that uses the Java Native Method Interface
               (JNI) to implement the Java calls to the HDF library.

       Together these provide access to almost all the routines
       of the HDF library.  This interface may be used by any
       Java application that wants to use the HDF library.

       Note that this is an interface to the regular HDF library,
       it is NOT an implementation of HDF written in Java.

       The Java Interface to HDF requires Java JDK 1.1.3 or above.
       This cannot be used with JDK 1.02, and has not been tested
       with JDK 1.2.

  Java HDF Viewer (JHV):

       The JHV is a Java application to browse HDF files.  The
       JHV uses the Java Interface for HDF.  The JHV is a standalone
       application, it cannot be used as a network loadable applet.

  For more information, see the on-line documentation at:

     http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/java-hdf-html/

2. Obtaining and Installing JHI and JHV
   ====================================

    The most recent version of the distribution can be obtained from
    the NCSA ftp archive site at:

       ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/Java

    The Java products are available in several ready-to-run versions.
    See the web page at:
    
         http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/java-hdf-html/download.html
    
    If Java is not installed, select the self-contained 'JRE' 
    version for the platform.
    
    If the JDK or other Java runtime is installed, then select 
    the self-installing script or pre-compiled version for the
    platform.
    
    If Java and C compilers are available, the full source
    can be compiled, as discussed below.

    This software must be compiled with the HDF 4.1r2 library.  If HDF 
    is already installed, it is probably not necessary to install or 
    compile it again.  To obtain the HDF library, see:

       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/

    or send email to hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu.

    To obtain the latest version of Java, see the web pages for your
    platform(s), as suggested below.

    The HDF Java Products have been compiled and tested on the following 
    platforms:
  
    Platform(OS)           Java Development Kit Version
    ------------           ----------------------------

3.  Building the HDF Java Products from source
    ==========================================

    For compiling and installing the Java HDF API and JHV
    on a system, please follow these instructions. 

3.1 Supported Platforms
    ===================

    This product requires Java Development Kit JDK 1.1.3 or above.
    Not all platforms support Java at this level yet, and we have
    not tested all platforms that have JDK 1.1.
    
    This software must be compiled with the HDF 4.1r2 library.  If HDF 
    is already installed, it is probably not necessary to install or 
    compile it again.  To obtain the HDF library, see:
    
        http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/
    
    or send email to:

3.2 General Configuration/Installation - Unix
    =========================================

    3.2.1 Overview
    --------------        
    This distribution uses a gnu 'configure' script to guess the
    correct configuration.

    The configuration script asks for information which is very 
    difficult to automatically determine:

	   1.  The location of the HDF library and include files.
               This may be a compiled distribution, or previously
               installed libraries.
	   2.  The location of the Java Development Kit JDK 1.1.x.
               This varies across different platforms.
	   3.  Where to install HDF Java.  This might not be
	       the same location as the regular HDF library.

    As this is a relatively complex configuration, it is recommended
    that you inspect the Makefiles to make sure they are correct.

    3.2.2 Layout of the distribution
    --------------------------------

    There are eight subdirectories in this directory:

     Config -- contains support for the configure script


     bin    -- the jhv invocation script
     lib    -- the directory for the compiled classes, native libraries
               and icons used for the jhv browser
     docs   -- the directory for the users guide and javadoc documentation 
               pages
     samples -- some sample hdf files
     ncsa   -- source codes for the java class packages including ncsa.hdf.awt,
               ncsa.hdf.hdflib, ncsa.hdf.io, ncsa.hdf.jhv, ncsa.hdf.message,
               ncsa.hdf.server and ncsa.hdf.util. The details of these packages
               are in the documentation pages.
     native -- source for the native (C) support for the java classes.
               This includes the Java HDF API (hdflib) and support
               for the jhv.
 

    3.2.3 Layout of configuration files
    -----------------------------------
    The following shows the layout of the files used in the configuration
    of the HDF Java API and JHV distribution.

    $(toplevel)/configure 
                configure.in (gnu -- used to generate 'configure')
                Config/config.guess
                Config/config.sub
                Config/install-sh
                Makefile.in

                native/Makefile.in
                native/hdflib/Makefile.in
                native/jhv/Makefile.in

                bin/jhv.in  (used to generate the 'jhv' script)


    3.2.4 Running configure
    -----------------------
    To build both of the libraries contained in this directory,
    run the ``configure'' script in $(toplevel), e.g.:

	./configure

    If you're using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need 
    to type `sh ./configure instead to prevent `csh' from trying to 
    execute `configure' itself.

    The configuration is saved in the file 'config.cache'.  You can
    rebuild the Makefiles as many times as you want using this cached 
    configuration.  If you want to change the configuration, delete
    the file 'cache.config' and run 'configure' again.

    3.2.5 Compiling and Installing
    ---------------------------------------
    To compile the Java HDF library and JHV type:

        make 

    To find out the available make targets type:

        make help

    To install the libraries, classes, and browser pages type: 

        make install

    To install the javadoc man pages, type:

	make install-javadoc

    To install the User's Guide, type:

	make install-ug

    This will also configure the JHV to use the User's Guide from local
    disk, rather than from the HDF web server.

    3.2.6 Installation Location
    ---------------------------

    The 'configure' script asks for the location of where to install
    the HDF Java classes, libraries, and support files.
    If you prefer, you can specify the directory so that `make install'
    will install the files directly in it.  This is done by giving
    `configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'.

    eg.  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/java/hdf

    This will configure the distribution to install the libraries,
    utilities, and doc files in '/usr/local/java/hdf/lib', 
    '/usr/local/java/hdf/lib/classes.zip', '/usr/local/java/hdf/bin', 
    and '/usr/local/java/hdf/docs' respectively.

4.  Platform-specific Notes
    ========================

    4.1 Windows '95 or Windows NT
    -------------------------------
    The NCSA HDF Java products should compile on a Windows '95 or 
    Windows NT machine.  The build procedure depends on your compile
    environment.

    For more information about install the Java HDF Products, please
    read the ReadmeWindows file.

    4.2  Irix 6.x
    -------------
    The JHV 2.2 bundled with JRE works for any Irix 6.x system.

    The pre-compiled versions of the JHV can be executed on any
    Irix6.x system with JDK 1.1.6.

    The JHV 2.2 can be compiled for Irix 6.x with the following 
    configuration:
        * JDK 1.1.6
        * HDF 4.1r2 irix6.2 and irix64_6.4-n32.  (Irix64_6.4-64 does 
          NOT work)

    Other configurations can be made to work by rebuilding the JHV
    and/or the HDF library.  See:

       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/java-hdf-html/irix.html

    4.3 HPUX
    --------
    The NCSA Java products are not currently available for HPUX.

    Java JDK 1.1 is not supported for HPUX 9.x. 

    In order to use native code from Java, the library must be compiled
    as a dynamically loadable library.  The HDF library is not available
    as a dynamic library for 10.20.  Furthermore, experiments 
    suggest that the HDF library may be too large to link to
    Java applications.

    For these reasons, the HDF Java products are not available 
    for HPUX systems.

    4.4 MacOS
    ---------
    HDF 4.1r2 and JDK 1.1 are available for the MacOS, and the HDF 
    Java Products should work.  This port has not been completed
    at the time of this release.

    4.5 Other Platforms
    -------------------

    There are many Unix platforms which support JDK 1.1, including
    AIX and DEC/OSF.  The NCSA Java products should work on 
    all these platforms, but have not been tested on them.


5. Man pages (javadoc) and User's Guide
   ====================================

    The `javadoc' utility was used to automatically create manual
    pages for the NCSA HDF Java products.  The javadoc pages are
    available on-line at:

       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/java-hdf-html/javadocs/

    To generate your own copy of the man pages with 'javadoc', type:
         make javadocs

6. Release notes and Documentation
   ===============================

   Release notes, documentation, and FAQs are available on-line at:

       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/java-hdf-html/

   The JHV User's Guide is available at:

       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/java-hdf-html/jhv/UsersGuide/JHV2.2/index.html

   The User's Guide is included in the distribution, and can be viewed
   by selecting from the "Help" menu.
