               README for HDF Java Interface and JHV
               --------------------------------------

Contents of this release
------------------------

This package contains the complete Java interface for the
HDF 4.1r1 library, and the Java HDF Viewer application.

  Java Interface for HDF:

       The Java interface for HDF consists of two parts:
            1. Java classes to interface, including 'native methods'
               and support for Java Exceptions, and data conversion.
            2. C-library that uses the Java Native Method Interface
               (JNI) to implement the Java calls to the HDF library.

       Together these provide access to almost all the routines
       of the HDF library.  This interface may be used by any
       Java application that wants to use the HDF library.

       Note that this is an interface to the regular HDF library,
       it is NOT an implementation of HDF written in Java.

       The Java Interface to HDF requires Java JDK 1.1.1 or above.
       This cannot be used with JDK 1.02.

  Java HDF Viewer (JHV):

       The JHV is a Java application to browse HDF files.  The
       JHV uses the Java Interface for HDF.  Thd JHV is a standalone
       application, it cannot be used as a network loadable applet.

       The JHV consists of three parts (plus the Java HDF interface):
           1.  Java classes for the appliation (windows, controls,
               and so on.)
           2.  A java package for 'palette' (look up table) manipulation.
           3.  A small amount of C-code to support data conversion


Obtaining the latest version
----------------------------
 The most recent version of the distribution can be obtained from
 the NCSA ftp archive site at:

     ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF_Current

Distribution Layout
-------------------
 There are eight subdirectories in this directory:

   Config -- contains support for the configure script


   bin    -- the jhv invocation script
   hdficons -- icons used for the jhv browser
   lib    -- the directory for the compiled classes and native libraries
   docs   -- the directory for the javadoc documentation pages
   samples -- some sample hdf files

   java   -- source for the java classes in java package 'java.*'
             This includes several support classes for the jhv.
   ncsa   -- source for the java classes in java package 'ncsa.hdf.*'
             This includes the Java HDF interface (ncsa.hdf.hdflib),
             palette manipulation classes (ncsa.hdf.palette), and
             the Java HDF Viewer (JHV) (ncsa.hdf.jhv).
   native -- source for the native (C) support for the java classes.
             This includes the Java HDF API (hdflib) and support
             for the jhv (jhvlib).

Software Requirements:
----------------------

 This software must be compiled with the HDF 4.1 library.  If
 HDF is already installed, it is not necessary to install or compile
 it again.

System Requirements
-------------------
 To build the HDF Java API and JHV from source, you need:

   * an ANSI C compiler.

   * Java Development Kit JDK 1.1.x
     ***This product cannot be compiled with JDK 1.02***

Configuring/Testing/Installing 
-------------------------------------------------------------
 See the INSTALL file for instructions on configuring
 and installing for Unix and non-UNIX systems.

DOCUMENTATION/FAQ/HELP
----------------------
 The HDF 4.1r1 documentation can be found on the NCSA ftp server
 in the directory /HDF/Documentation/HDF4.1r1.  The
 HDF home page is at:

      http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/

 An FAQ is available on our ftp server, as well as under
 "Information about HDF" in the home page.
