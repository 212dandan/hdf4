     ---------------- Invoking the Makefile ------------------ 

A Makefile is provided for building HDF3.3.  Open the Makefile
in your editor and read the instructions at the top of the file.
The section marked PORTING INSTRUCTIONS indicates that you need
to modify certain lines in order to configure the Makefile for your
particular system.

Make targets available are :
make            -- compile and install library and utilities
make all        -- compile and install library and utilities
make allnostub  -- compile and install library without
	           Fortran stub routines, and utilities
make libdf.a    -- compile library
make libnostub  -- compile library with Fortran stub routines
make utils      -- compile utilities
make install    -- install library and utilities
make clean      -- rm intermediate files
make cleanup    -- rm all make products


    --------------- Compiling Subsets of HDF ---------------

In order to use HDF, you must compile the C routines using the
following modules: hfile.c, hfile.h, hdf.h, hdfi.h, herr.c, herr.h,
hkit.c and hproto.h.  You can omit various other routines by
deleting references to certain files from the makefile, as
follows:

 To omit selected fortran interfaces, delete all references to
     fortran files that contain those interfaces (xxx.f) and 
     their object files (xxx.o).

Similarly:

  To omit DFR8 routines, delete files that begin dfr8...
  To omit DF24 routines, delete files that begin df24...
  To omit DFP  routines, delete files that begin dfp...
  To omit DFSD routines, delete files that begin dfsd...
  To omit DFAN routines, delete files that begin dfan...
  To omit Vset routines, delete files that begin v...
  To omit conversion routines (currently only used by DFSD
     and Vset), delete files that begin dfconv...
  To omit the routines that emulate the old lower layer
     of HDF, delete df.h, dfi.h, df.c, dfF.c and dfFf.f


     ------------ Compiling C programs with HDF ----------------

To use HDF routines in your program, use "#include dfrig.h", "#include dfsd.h"
etc. at the top of your program, depending on the Sets you are using.
Call the appropriate HDF routines as described in the documentation. 
Compile your C program "myprog.c" as follows:

    cc myprog.c libdf.a -o myprog

If the include file "dfrig.h" is in the directory "incdir", and the 
library file "libdf.a" is in "libdir", use

    cc -Iincdir myprog.c libdir/libdf.a -o myprog


           ------------ Testing HDF ----------------

A partial test suite should be included in this distribution.
A Makefile and instructions are included with this test suite.
