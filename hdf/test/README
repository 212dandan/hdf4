This directory contains the test suite for the basic library libdf.a.
After running the make file at either the higher level or this level,
you will find two executable programs, testhdf and fortest, in this 
directory. Testhdf tests the C functions, while fortest the Fortran 
interface. At the end of execution, each program reports how many 
errors happened. Please contact us at hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu 
if the test fails on your machine.

Special notes for fortest:
"fortest" is just a C-code front to parse command line arguments.
It produces a file, fortest.arg which contains lines of instruction
to invoke the real fortran test which is called fortestF.  Each line
in fortest.arg contains a command and a parameter.

	Command		Parameter	Description
	-------		---------	-----------

	Test		Name		Test <Name>
	Skip		Name		Skip test <Name>
	Cleanup		Integer		Do not cleanup *.hdf files
	Verbosity	Integer		Verbosity = <Integer>


"fortest" then invokes "fortestF" with "fortest.arg" as input.
