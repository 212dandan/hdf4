      Installation Instructions for HDF4.2r3 on Windows XP/Vista
========================================================================

The instructions which follow assume that you will be using the HDF4 source code 
archive from HDF website (http://hdfgroup.org).

In building HDF4 from source code you may select between two build environment 
options (with Fortran or without Fortran).  

***************************WARNINGS*************************************
Please read CAREFULLY about the following preconditions first.

Preconditions

To build the HDF4 and MFHDF libraries ( single-threaded static or multi-threaded 
DLL) and utilities, it is assumed that you have done the following:
      
   1. Installed Microsoft Visual Studio
   
      1.1 Currently, Visual Studio 6.0, .NET 2003, and 2005 are supported.
          However, Visual Studio 6.0 project files will soon be phased out, so 
          building with .NET 2003 or 2005 is recommended.

      1.2 To build Fortran libraries, you must install the Intel Fortran 9.1 or 
          10.1 compiler.  This requires Visual Studio using .NET 2003 or 2005.
          Intel Fortran 10.1 is not supported under Visual Studio .NET 2003, and
          thus requires Visual Studio 2005.

   2. Set up a directory structure to unpack the source code archive.
      For example: 

         c:\                             (any drive)
         MyHDFstuff\                     (any folder name)

   3. Download the HDF4.2r3 source code archive HDF4.2r3.tar.gz from
      ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF/HDF_Current/src and use 7zip or WinZip
      to extract HDF4 source code into c:\MyHDFstuff.  This creates a 
      directory called 'HDF4.2r3' under MyHDFstuff which contains 
      several files and directories.  Rename "HDF4.2r3" to "HDF42r3".  

   4. HDF4 provides options to do in-memory compress within HDF4
      library.  Currently, three external compression libraries ZLIB,
      JPEG, and SZIP can be used with HDF4.

      4.1 HDF4 uses Zlib version 1.2.3 for compression.  To use Zlib
          library, you have to install your own Zlib DLL library or go
          to ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/zlib/1.2/bin/windows
          to download the Zlib library.  Be sure to choose the correct
          binaries for your compiler.

          Zlib compression feature inside HDF4 is required.
      
      4.2 HDF4 uses JPEG release 6b for compression.  To use JPEG
          library, you have to install your own JPEG library or go to
          ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/jpeg/bin/windows to download
          the JPEG library archive file.  Be sure to choose the correct
          binaries for your compiler.

          JPEG compression feature inside HDF4 is required.

      4.3 HDF4 uses Szip version 2.1 for compression. To use Szip
          library, you can download Szip source codes and binaries
          from ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/szip/2.1/bin/windows
          Be sure to choose the correct binaries for your compiler.

          Please note that Szip is not a totally open-source free
          software.  For licensing issue of Szip, please check 
          "Licensing terms" at
          http://hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP/index.html.

          Szip compression feature inside HDF4 is optional. 
      
   5. Define the following environment variables: 

          HDF4_EXT_ZLIB
          HDF4_EXT_JPEG
          HDF4_EXT_SZIP
      
      In this section, Szip compression software is assumed to be used.
      Please read section VI as well as this section if you do not
      want to use Szip compression feature inside HDF4.
      
      To define these environment variables:
      
      Click "Start", click "Control Panel", and then double-click
      "System".  On the "Advanced" tab, click "Environment Variables".
      
      If you are logged on as administrator to the local computer AND
      want to let all other users use these three environment variables,
      click "New" under "System Variables" box; otherwise, click "New"
      under "User Variables" box.
      
      In the New Variable window, set "Variable name" as HDF4_EXT_ZLIB
      and "Variable value" as zlib1.lib, then click OK.
      
      Similarly, you can set:

      HDF4_EXT_JPEG environment variable as libjpeg.lib
      HDF4_EXT_SZIP environment variable as szlibdll.lib

      Notes:

         a. You might have to close and reopen running programs for the
            new environment variable settings to take effect. 

         b. c:\zlib\zlib1.dll and c:\szlib\dll\szlibdll.dll should
            be copied into the location that the application can find,
            such as c:\WINDOWS\system
      
   6. Set up paths for external libraries and headers
 
      Invoke Microsoft Visual Studio and go to "Tools" and select
      "Options", find "Projects", and then "VC++ Directories"
      
      6.1 Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Include files",
          If you cannot find your Zlib, JPEG, and Szip header path
          (for example, c:\zlib\include, c:\jpeg\include, 
          c:\szip\include) from the directory list, add the header
          path (c:\zlib\include, c:\jpeg\include, c:\szip\include) to
          the included directories.
      
      6.2 Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Library files",
          If you cannot find your Zlib, JPEG, and Szip library path
          (for example, c:\zlib\dll, c:\jpeg\lib, c:\szip\dll)
          from the directory list, add the library path
          (c:\zlib\dll, c:\jpeg-6b, c:\szip\dll) to the library
          directories.

Section I: Build and Test HDF4 Libraries and Utilities
======================================================================

Step 1: Build HDF4 Libraries and Utilities

Notes:

   a. These instructions are written for MicroSoft Visual Studio .NET 2005
      users.  For Visual Studio 6.0 users, please also read Section III.  For
      Visual Studio .NET 2003 users, please also read Section IV.  To also build
      Fortran libraries using Intel Fortran 9.1 or 10.1, please also read 
      Section V.
      
   b. To build HDF4 Multithreaded static library, please read Section IX.

Building Instructions:

   1. Run batch file copy_hdf.bat

      Go to  c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\windows and run copy_hdf.bat. This process will 
      copy all the necessary batch files and Windows-specific source code saved 
      under c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\windows directory to the corresponding directories 
      under MyHDFstuff.

   2. Invoke Microsoft Visual Studio, go to "File" and select the "Open 
      Solution" option. 

      Then open the c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\windows\proj\all\all.sln solution. 

      You should find windows project files listed as "all files, 
      big files etc." on the left.        
             
   3. Select "Build", then Select "Configuration Manager".
   
      3.1 To build debug static libraries, 
          Debug multithreaded DLLs and tests:
            
          Under "Active Solution Configuration", select "Debug", select "Close". 
          Select "Build" -> "Build Solution" or "Rebuild Solution" to
          build debug version of HDF.
        
      3.2 To build release static libraries, 
          multithreaded DLLs and tests:
        
          Under "Active Solution Configuration", select "Release", select "Close". 
          Select "Build" -> "Build Solution" or "Rebuild Solution" to
          build release version of HDF.
                
      Both debug and release versions must be built.
       
      Warning messages can be ignored. 

      When the debug build is done, output files will be built in directories
      corresponding to their source code, in the .\Debug subdirectory.
      
      When the release build is done, output files will be built in directories
      corresponding to their source code, in the .\Release subdirectory.


Step 2: Test HDF4 Libraries and Utilities

HDF4 libraries and utilities should be tested to make sure that they were built 
correctly.

We provide 2 options for users to test HDF4 libraries and utilities.  

   3.1 Option 1: Automatic testings

   HDF4 comes with various test suites, all of which can be tested with 
   hdf4check.bat batch file in c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\ directory.
   
   Invoke a command prompt and run hdf4check.bat.  Test results are saved in:

      c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\check_results.txt.

   Use a text editor to check the results.  You should not find any FAILED 
   marks in check_results.txt.

   3.2 Option 2: Step-by-step HDF4 libraries and utilities testings

   You can also test debug and release versions of HDF4 libraries and utilities 
   separately.
   
       3.2.1 Install HDF4 Dlls for C library
       
       User who want to test ONLY HDF4 C libraries and utilities, the
       following DLLs should be placed into the Windows system directory.
       
       Batch file c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\install_dll.bat will copy all of 
       following DLLS into system directory.
       
        HDF42r3\hdf\src\Debug\hd423md.dll
        HDF42r3\mfhdf\libsrc\Debug\hm423md.dll
                                                        
        HDF42r3\hdf\src\Release\hd423m.dll
        HDF42r3\mfhdf\libsrc\release\hm423m.dll
          
       3.2.2 Test HDF4 C library
       
       To test debug version of HDF4 C library, run Win32debugtst.bat;
       To test release version of HDF4 C library, run Win32releasetst.bat.
          
       We strongly suggest you to redirect your testing results into an
       output file so that you can easily check the testing results.  Use a text 
       editor to check the results.  You should not find any FAILED 
       marks in check_results.txt.
       
      
Step 3: ncgen -c test (Optional)
      
ncgen is a netCDF utility that converts a CDL description of a netCDF
file into an HDF file, or that generates the C or Fortran source
code required to create a netCDF file.

HDF4 includes "ncgen -c test" to test whether ncgen can generate the
C source code required to create a netCDF file.

Note:
     Currently, ncgen can not generate the Fortran source code
     required to create a netCDF file by HDF4 on Windows.
  
     So "ncgen -f test" is not supported by HDF4 on Windows.
 
ncgen project should have been built in step 2 before you can run
"ncgen -c test" on Windows.

Follow the instructions below to run "ncgen -c test" on Windows.

   1. Open all.sln Workspace

      Invoke Microsoft Visual Studio, go to "File" and select the
      "Open Solution" option. 

      Then open the c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\windows\proj\all\all.sln solution. 

   2. Build ctest0.exe

      Select "Build", then Select "Configuration Manager".

      On Windows platform select as the active configuration

         "Debug" to build debug versions ctest0

         or
 
         "Release" to build release versions of ctest0


      Right click on  the "ctest0" project and select "Build".

      You should see 0 error at the end of building.  Warning messages can be 
      ignored.

      When the debug build is done the directories listed below will
      contain the following files:

         c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\mfhdf\ncgen\Debug

               ctest0.exe - Debug version

         c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\mfhdf\ncgen\Release

               ctest0.exe - Release version

   3. Run ncgen -c Test

      A batch file named ncgen_ctest.bat under c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\
      is provided to run "ncgen -c test".

      ncgen_ctest.bat has 2 options:

         ncgen_ctest debug    -- debug version ncgen -c test 

         ncgen_ctest release  -- release version ncgen -c test

      Invoke a command prompt windows and run ncgen_ctest.bat with
      appropriate options, you should get the following messages:

         =========================
         ncgen -c test
         =========================
         *** ncgen -c test successful ***


Step 4:  Install HDF4 Library

We provide a batch file for users to relocate all HDF4 libraries in one
folder.  The file is called installhdf4lib.bat under
c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3 directory.  Run the batch file, you may see a
folder called hdf4lib under c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3.  
    
The <release> layout of <hdf4lib> should be:
    
   release\include   --  HDF4 header files
   release\bin       --  HDF4 static utility executables
   release\lib       --  HDF4 static libraries
   release\dll       --  HDF4 multi-threaded libraries and DLLs
       
You may also find the similar layout for the <debug>.


Step 5: Building HDF4 C examples (Optional)

Simple examples have been provided for users to test HDF4 C library and 
utilities.

Note: To build HDF4 Fortran examples, please refer to Section V.
      
To build and test HDF4 C examples:

   1. Invoke Microsoft Visual Studio, go to "File" and select the "Open 
      Solution" option. 
      
      Then open the solution
      c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\windows\examples\cexamples\proj\allexamples.sln

   2. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".

      In "Configuration Manager", select the active configuration

          "Debug" to build debug versions of the C examples.

                          or
	
          "Release" to build release versions the C examples.

      When the debug build or release build is done, there should be the 
      following output files in 
      c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\windows\examples\cexamples\Debug

          chgnamtest.exe
          createtest.exe
          dimtest.exe
          gitest.exe
          rattrtest.exe
          readtest.exe
          sattrest.exe
          sds2grouptest.exe
          sh_dimtest.exe
          unltest.exe
          
       Similar output will be in the Release directory for release build.

   3. Invoke a command prompt window and run the batch file InstallExamples.bat 
      which resides in the top level directory (c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\).  This 
      file creates 2 new directories, examplesREL and examplesDBG in the 
      c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\windows\examples\cexamples directory and places all 
      the executables in it.  Both the release and debug versions of the 
      examples should be built before this step is done.  The examples should be 
      tested in these 2 new directories due to some dependencies between the 
      examples.  Especially createtest.exe should be executed before gitest.exe
      and sattrtest.exe, and rattrtest should be executed immediately after 
      sattrtest.exe due to the dependencies among these files.


   
Section II. Build an Application Using the HDF4 Library
======================================================================

If you are building an application that uses the HDF4 library, the
following locations will need to be specified for locating header files
and linking in the HDF4 libraries:
 
   <top-level HDF directory>\lib
   <top-level HDF directory>\dll
   <top-level HDF directory>\include

where <top-level HDF directory> may be
c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\hdf4lib\release or
c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\hdf4lib\debug

If you have installed HDF4 library in Section I, Step 5.

We assume that you will use the Szip compression with HDF4 library.

To specify these locations in the settings for your VC++ project with
Microsoft Visual Studio .NET:

Under Tools->Options, select the folder "Projects", and then "VC++ Directories":
   Under "Show directories for", select "Include files".
   Add the following directories:
      c:<path to HDF includes>\include  

Under "Show directories for", select "Library files":
   Add the following directories:
      c:<path to HDF libs>\lib
      c:<path to HDF libs>\dll

Under Project->Properties, select folder, Linker, and then Input:
   Add the following libraries to the beginning of the list of "Additional
   Dependencies":
      hd423.lib hm423.lib xdr.lib Ws2_32.lib (single-threaded release version)
      hd423d.lib hm423d.lib xdr.lib Ws2_32.lib (single-threaded debug version)

      hd423m.lib hm423m.lib xdr_for_dll.lib Ws2_32.lib(multi-threaded release version)
      hd423md.lib hm423md.lib xdr_for_dll.lib Ws2_32.lib(multi-threaded debug version)

      (Optional) For applications which use HDF4 Fortran libraries, except the 
      libraries listed above, users should also add the following libraries to 
      the list of Additional Dependencies:
      
      For static release version:
        mfhdf_fortran.lib hdf_fortran.lib

      For static debug version:
        mfhdf_fortran.lib hdf_fortran.lib

      For shared DLL release version:
        mfhdf_fortrandll.lib hdf_fortrandll.lib
 
      For shared DLL debug version:
        mfhdf_fortrandlld.lib hdf_fortrandlld.lib 

      HDF4_EXT_ZLIB
      HDF4_EXT_JPEG
      HDF4_EXT_SZIP

Note: The above three environment variables should have been defined in
      the preconditions.  Paths for these external libraries and
      headers should also have been set up in preconditions.

      Follow the instructions in preconditions to define these three
      environment variables and set up path for these external libraries
      and headers if you can not find them.

HDF4 DLLs should also be copied to the system directory (for example,
C:\Windows\system) where the application can find. 

Note: You can also follow the above instructions in this section if want to 
      build an application using the HDF42r3 binary distributions available from
      ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF/HDF_Current/bin/windows.

      Make sure to download appropriate binary distribution based on your 
      Windows platforms and compilers.

      If you can not find the binary distribution matching with your Windows 
      platforms and compilers, you will have to build HDF4 libraries and 
      utilities from the source codes.

      Also, these binary distributions were pre-compiled with Szip compression 
      feature inside HDF4 library.  If you do not want to use the Szip 
      compression feature, you will have to build HDF4 libraries and utilities 
      from the source code following the instructions in Section VI.
     

Section III. Build HDF4 in Visual Studio 6.0
======================================================================

Notes: 
 1. Although Visual Studio 6.0 project files are currently provided, Visual
    Studio 6.0 support is marked for depreciation.  It is recommended that you
    use Visual Studio .NET 2003 or 2005 to build HDF4 instead.  A free version of
    Visual Studio 2005 Express is available from Microsoft.
    
 2. Building Fortran libraries is not supported in Visual Studio 6.0.  We
    support the Intel Fortran Compiler 9.1or 10.1, which requires Visual Studio 
    .NET or 2005.  For more information on building Fortran libraries, please 
    see Section V.


Building HDF4 with Visual Studio 6.0 is very similar to building with .NET or
2005.  Aside from subtle differences in the IDE terminology, very much is the 
same.  Therefore, you may refer to the instructions in Section I, with the 
following modifications:

    1. Visual Studio requires project files in a different format; it uses
       .dsw and .dsp files, while more recent versions use .sln and .vcproj
       files.  As a result, we have created seperate folders for Visual Studio
       6.0 project files for building libraries and examples.  When opening
       projects, look for the "proj_vs6" folder, rather than "proj".  For
       example, to open the main HDF4 workspace, you would look for "all.dsw"
       in c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\windows\proj_vs6\all\.  Similarly, you can
       build C example applications by opening "allexamples.dsw" in
       c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF423r3\windows\examples\cexamples\proj_vs6\.
       
    2. Building Fortran libraries with Visual Studio 6.0 is not supported.
       Therefore, Fortran projects are disabled in the project files by default,
       and Fortran example projects are not included for Visual Studio 6.0.
    
    3. By default, single-threaded static libraries are built, along with Multi-
       threaded DLLs.  If you would like to build all multithreaded libraries,
       please read Section IX.
       
    4. Building and testing ctest0.exe requires on additional step with Visual
       Studio 6.0.  The build process in Visual Studio .NET 2003 and above 
       internally generates source file test0.c.  If you are using Visual Studio
       6.0, you must generate this file manually.  To do so, we provide a batch 
       file "ctest0_gen.bat" under c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\ directory.  Run this 
       script from a command prompt with the following options:
      
         ctest0_gen debug    -- generate test0.c with debug ncgen 

         ctest0_gen release  -- generate test0.c with release ncgen
         
       After this script is run, you may build ctest0 by following the
       instructions in Section I.
       
       
    
Section IV: Build HDF4 in Visual Studio .NET 2003
======================================================================

The building procedure is almost identical as building HDF4 Visual Studio 2005. 
Please refer to Section I, with a few minor changes:

    1. Visual Studio requires project files in a different format; it uses
       the same file extensions, but different internal format.  As a result, 
       we have created seperate folders for Visual Studio 2003 project files for 
       building libraries and examples.  When opening projects, look for the 
       "proj_vnet" folder, rather than "proj".  For example, to open the main 
       HDF4 workspace, you would look for "all.sln" in 
       c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\windows\proj_vnet\all\.  Similarly, you can
       build C example applications by opening "allexamples.sln" in
       c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF423r3\windows\examples\cexamples\proj_vnet\.  Use
       similar directories for building Fortran libraries.

    2. Be sure to download the correct external library binaries from the FTP.  
       
    3. By default, single-threaded static libraries are built, along with Multi-
       threaded DLLs.  If you would like to build all multithreaded libraries,
       please read Section IX.
       


Section V. Build HDF4 with Fortran Libraries
======================================================================

Currently, HDF4 is supported with Intel Fortran Compilers 9.1 or 10.1.  Intel
Fortran 9.1 is supported under Visual Studio .NET or 2005.  Intel Fortran 10.1
is supported only under Visual Studio 2005.

The build process for Fortran libraries is very similar to building without.  
Therefore, you may follow the instuctions presented in Section I, with the
following modifications.


Step 1: Build HDF4 Libraries and Utilities


Building Instructions:

   1. Rather than using the solution "all.sln", open "all_fortran.sln" which
      is located in c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\windows\proj\all_fortran\ directory.

      You should see normal Visual Studio projects, as well as pre-converted
      Intel Fortran projects.
      
   2. When the build is done, addition output files will be built in directories
      corresponding to their Fortran source code.
        

Step 2: Test HDF4 Libraries and Utilities

    1. To test HDF Fortran libraries as well as C libraries, run hdf4check.bat
       with the following options:
       
        hdf4check enablefortran
        
    2. You can also test debug and release versions of HDF4 Fortran and C 
       libraries and utilities seperately.  The following DLLs should be placed
       in the Windows system directory, in addition to those listed in Section 
       I.  A batch file, c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\install_fortrandll.BAT, will
       copy all of the DLLs for you.
       
        c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\hdf\src\Debug\hdf_fcstubdlld.dll
        c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\hdf\src\Debug\hdf_fortrandlld.dll
        c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\mfhdf\fortran\Debug\mfhdf_fortrandlld.dll
        c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\mfhdf\fortran\Debug\mfhdf_fcstubdlld.dll
        c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\hdf\test\Debug\dlllibtest_fcstubd.dll

        c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\hdf\src\Release\hdf_fcstubdll.dll
        c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\hdf\src\Release\hdf_fortrandll.dll
        c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\mfhdf\fortran\Release\mfhdf_fortrandll.dll
        c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\mfhdf\fortran\Release\mfhdf_fcstubdll.dll
        c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\hdf\test\Release\dlllibtest_fcstub.dll      
        
       To test debug version of HDF4 C and Fortran libraries, run 
       Win32debugtst.bat with the following command:
       
        Win32debugtst enablefortran
        
       To test release version of HDF4 C and Fortran libraries, run 
       Win32releasetst.bat with the following command:
          
        Win32releasetst enablefortran



Step 5: Building HDF4 Examples (Optional)

In addition to the C examples, we also provide a suite of Fortran examples
to test the HDF4 Fortran libraries.  To build and test HDF4 Fortran example:

   1. Invoke Visual Studio, go to "File" and select the "Open Solution" option.

      Then open the soltuion
      c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\windows\examples\f90examples\proj\allf90examples.sln.

   2. Select "Build", then Select "Configuration Manager".

      In "Active Soltuion Configuration", select the active configuration

          "Debug" to build debug versions of the Fortran examples.
          
            or
            
          "Release" to build release versions the Fortran examples.

      When the debug build or release build is done, there should be the 
      following output files in 
      c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\windows\examples\f90examples\Debug

          createtest.exe
          gitest.exe
          rattrtest.exe
          readtest.exe
          sattrest.exe 
          sds2grouptest.exe
          sh_dimtest.exe
          unltest.exe

       Similar output will be in the Release directory for release build.
       
   3. Invoke a command prompt and run the batch file Installf90Examples.bat 
      which resides in the top level directory (c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\).  This 
      file creates 2 new directories, f90examplesREL and f90examplesDBG in the 
      c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\windows\f90xamples\cexamples directory and places 
      all the executables in them.  Both the release and debug versions of the 
      examples should be built before this step is done.  The examples should be 
      tested in these 2 new directories due to some dependencies between the 
      examples.  Especially createtest.exe should be executed before gitest.exe
      and sattrtest.exe, and rattrtest should be executed immediately after 
      sattrtest.exe due to the dependencies among these files.


Section VI. Disable Szip Compression Feature inside HDF4
======================================================================

Warning: When you modify the h4config.h file as described below,
         DO NOT just change the values of these macros from 1 to 0.
         Please DO remove(or comment out) appropriate lines.
         
When disabling Szip in HDF4 libraries, users have two options.  Szip compress
can be removed completely, or szip can be used without encoding.

Option 1: Remove Szip compression completely:

   1. Open the H4config.h file from the c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\hdf\src
      directory and remove(or comment out) the following two lines: 

         #define H4_HAVE_LIBSZ 1
         #define H4_HAVE_SZLIB_H 1

      Then save the file.

   2. Delete HDF4_EXT_SZIP environment variable if you have set it in
      preconditions.
   
   3. Run-compile HDF4 library according to Section I.

      When you disable Szip, you may get the following message when building 
      HDF4 libraries:

      The following environment variables were not found
      $(HDF4_EXT_SZIP)

      This message can be ignored.

      When you run HDF4 testing batch file Win32debugtst.bat or
      Win32releasetst.bat, you should get the following failed messages
      for HDF-SD c interfaces tests:

         ============================
         HDF-SD C interfaces tests
         ============================
         *** HDF fails formatted test ***
         Comparing files hdfout.new and ..\..\MFHDF\LIBSRC\HDFOUT.SAV
         ***** hdfout.new
         9 := 0
         ****** SD Szip test skipped *****
         num_err == 0
         ***** ..\..\MFHDF\LIBSRC\HDFOUT.SAV
         9 := 0
         num_err == 0
         *****

      This means that actually the HDF-SD C interfaces tests passed.
      The expected output file HDFOUT.SAV was generated for HDF4
      testings with Szip compression feature.  As you disabled the
      Szip compression feature in HDF4, SD Szip test should be skipped.

Option 2: Remove Szip Compression in HDF4

      If you would like to just disable Szip encoder from the HDF4
      library while keeping Szip decoder enabled, follow the steps
      below.

      1. Download Szip library without encoder

          Szip library is different if you want to disable Szip encoder.
          Download szip_noencoder binaries from
          ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/szip/2.1/bin/windows.
          The Szip library and header path should also be set up accordingly 
          (refer to precondition 6).

      2. Run-compile HDF4 library according to Section I.
      
      
Section VII:  Use HDF4 with Original netCDF Library
======================================================================
Note: This option has not been extensively tested in HDF4.2r3, and is therefore
      unsupported.  However, we provide documentation for users that would like
      to test this feature.

HDF4 Contains its own implementation of the netCDF library.  To use HDF4 in an
application also utilizing the original netCDF library, make the following
change:

      Open the H4config.h file from the c:\MyHDFstuff\HDF42r3\hdf\src
      directory and remove(or comment out) the following line: 

         #define H4_HAVE_NETCDF

      Then save the file and recompile HDF4 library according to Section I.

This will rename the HDF version of the C-interface(ncxxx) of the netCDF API to 
sd_ncxxx and disable NC Fortran interfaces to avoid clashing with the original 
netCDF C and Fortran APIs. 
      
      
      
Section VIII. Build and Test HDF4 Library on the Command Line    
======================================================================

We support command-line builds for the following configurations:
    
    -- Visual Studio 6.0 (no Fortran)
    -- Visual Studio .NET 2003 (no Fortran)
    -- Visual Studio 2005 (with or without Fortran) (32- or 64-bit)
    
For all other Windows development tools, HDF4 should be built in the development 
environment following the instructions in Section I.

1. Preconditions: 

   1.1 Setup Environment
   
       1.1.1 Verify Visual Studio
       
       Building from the command line requires environment variables for Visual
       Studio.  These are generally setup when Visual Studio is installed, but 
       you can verify by testing the variables from command prompt.  If you are
       build Fortran libraries, you will also need your environment set up for
       Intel Visual Fortran.  You may verify using the following commands in
       a terminal:
       
       For Visual Studio 6.0:
       
            if not defined msdevdir echo not defined!
       
       For Visual Studio .NET:
            
            if not defined vs71comntools echo not defined!
            
       For Visual Studio 2005:
       
            if not defined vs80comntools echo not defined!
            
       For Intel Visual Fortran 9.1:
       
            if not defined ifort_compiler91 echo not defined!
                  
       For Intel Visual Fortran 10.1:
       
            if not defined ifort_compiler10 echo not defined!
                  
       1.1.2 Add External Libraries
       
       HDF4 uses environmental variables to recognize external libraries.  To
       define the necessary variables, issue the following commands:

            set HDF4_EXT_ZLIB=zlib1.lib
            set HDF4_EXT_JPEG=libjpeg.lib
            set HDF4_EXT_SZIP=szlibdll.lib
        
       Also, you have the option of specifying external library directories on
       the command line, or to use the settings from within the IDE.  If you
       wish to use the settings within the IDE, set the library and include
       directories as in Section I.
       
       If you wish to specify directories from the command line, set the INCLUDE
       and LIB environment variables as follows:
       
            set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;C:\zlib\include;C:\jpeg-6b;C:\szip\include
            set LIB=%LIB%;C:\zlib\dll;C:\jpeg-6b;C:\szip\dll
       
       Notes:
       
        1. If your library names or paths differ from those listed, change the
           commands accordingly.
           
        2. If you specify directories on the command-line, be sure to use the
           "useenv" option below.
           
        3. If you plan to build without szip, then you may skip HDF4_EXT_SZIP
           and leave out the szip paths from INCLUDE and LIB variables.
           
        4. You may set these variables permanantly for a user account or the
           entire system through the Control Panel.  See the Preconditions
           for instruction.
           
   1.2 Run batch file copy_hdf.bat.

   Go to C:\MyHDFstuff\hdf4\windows and run copy_hdf.bat. 
      
2. Building and testing HDF4 libraries and tools

   We provide 2 options for users to build and test HDF4 libraries 
   and tools.
      
    2.1 Options A: Build and test in one step 
      
         A batch file named hdf4bt.bat in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf4 directory is 
         provided for users to build and test HDF4 library and tools together 
         from command line.

         hdf4bt.bat takes the following options:

            /?                      Help information
            vs8                     Build using Visual Studio 2005
            vnet                    Build using Visual Studio .NET
            vs6                     Build using Visual Studio 6.0
            enablefortran           Build and testHDF4 C/Fortran Library and
                                    Tools [default C only]
            ivf101                  Build HDF4 Fortran using Intel Visual Fortran 10.1
                                    [default Intel Visual Fortran 9.1]
            useenv                  Build using variables set in the environment.
            log                     Log the build and test results in files 
                                    defined by environment variables 
                                    HDF4BUILD_LOG and HDF4CHECK_LOG, or 
                                    hdf4build.log and hdf4check.log if undefined

         Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf4bt with the appropriate
         parameters.  You must specify one of "vs8", "vnet", or "vs6".  It is
         recommended that you pipe your results into a text file or use the
         "log" parameter.

         You may use a text-editor to verify results.  There should be no
         "FAILED" marks.

    2.2 Options B: Build and test in two steps 

         We also provide users with the option to build and test HDF4 libraries 
         and tools seperately.
   
         Step 1) Build HDF4 Libraries and Tools

            A batch file named hdf4build.bat in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf4 directory is 
            provided for users to build HDF4 library and tools from command line.

            hdf4build.bat takes the following options:

            /?                      Help information
            vs8                     Build using Visual Studio 2005
            vnet                    Build using Visual Studio .NET
            vs6                     Build using Visual Studio 6.0
            enablefortran           Build and testHDF4 C/Fortran Library and
                                    Tools [default C only]
            ivf101                  Build HDF4 Fortran using Intel Visual Fortran 10.1
                                    [default Intel Visual Fortran 9.1]
            useenv                  Build using variables set in the environment.

            Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf4build with the 
            appropriate parameters.  You must specify one of "vs8", "vnet", or 
            "vs6".  It is recommended that you pipe your results into a text 
            file for reviewing  You can check the file to find out whether there
            are any compilation errors.

         Step 2) Test HDF4 Libraries and Tools
   
            A batch file named hdf4check.bat in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf4 directory is 
            provided for users to test HDF4 library and tools from command line.

            hdf4check.bat takes the following option:
            
            enablefortran   Test HDF4 C/Fortran Libraries

            Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf4check with apropriate 
            options.It is recommended that you pipe your results into a text 
            file for reviewing.

            You may use a text-editor to verify results.  There should be no
            "FAILED" marks.

3. Installing HDF4 Libraries

Run the batch file c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf4\installhdf4lib.bat to install all
HDF4 libraries and tools into c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf4\hdf4lib directory.



Section IX: Build HDF4 Multithreaded Static Library
======================================================================

In this section, we just briefly introduce how to build HDF4 multithreaded 
static library.

Note: In Visual Studio 2005, the single-threaded runtime library is depreciated.
      Therefore, multithreaded is build by default, and no extra work needs to
      be done.  These instructions apply only to Visual Studio 6.0 and .NET.
      

Step I: The "Runtime library" settings for static projects should be
         modified as multithreaded.  Please following the instructions
         below to modify the "Runtime library" settings.

1. Right click project "hdf", go to Properties->C/C++->Code Generation;
   In the "Configuration:" text box, select "Debug";
   In the "Runtime Library" text box, select "Multi-threaded Debug (/MTD)";
   In the "Configuration:" text box, select "Release"; 
   In the "Runtime Library" text box, select "Multi-threaded (/MT)";
   Then press "OK".

2. Repeat step 1 to set the settings for "Runtime Library" for all static 
   projects.

Step II (Optional): If building Fortran libraries, their project settings must
          be similiarly changed to use multithreaded runtime libraries.
          
1. Right click project "hdf_fortran", go to Properties->Fortran->Libraries;
   In the "Configuration:" text box, select "Debug";
   In the "Runtime Library" text box, select "Debug Multi-threaded";
   In the "Configuration:" text box, select "Debug";
   In the "Runtime Library" text box, select "Multi-threaded";
   Then press "OK".

2. Repeat step 1 to set the settings for "Runtime Library" for all static 
   Fortran projects.

   

Section X: Build HDF4 for 64-bit Windows
======================================================================

HDF4 can be built for 64-bit Windows in Visual Studio 2005.  Visual Studio .NET
has very primative 64-bit support, but it is very difficult to setup, and
debugging is not supported.  Therefore, we recommend all users switch to 
Visual Studio 2005 for 64-bit builds.  

Notes:
  
    1. Building 64-bit HDF4 from a 32-bit machine is unsupported.  The testing
       suite requires running the built binaries, which isn't possible on a
       32-bit machine.
    
    
Prerequisites:

    1. A 64-bit Windows machine.
    
    2. Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 installed with x64 Extensions.
           

Building:

    Building 64-bit Windows binaries is very similar to the process for 32-bit.
    Therefore, you may follow the instructions in Section I with the following
    modifications.
    
        1. 64-bit HDF4 must be built with 64-bit external libraries, unless
           external library support is disabled.  You must add the include and
           library paths for x64 configurations as you have in the 
           "Prerequisites" section.  This is also true for Intel Fortran if
           Fortran libraries are to be built.  If you do not wish to use
           szip, please read Section VI about disabling it.     
           
        2. The x64 platform must be selected in the build configuration for
           debug and release versions.  Before building, go to "Build", 
           "Configuration Manager".  In the "Active solution platform" box, 
           select "x64", and press "Close".
           
        3. If building Fortran libraries, the 64-bit Intel Fortran compiler
           must be selected.  In Visual Studio, go to "Tools", "Options".  In
           the right pane, select "Intel(R) Fortran", "General".  In the 
           "Target Platform" box, select "x64".
           
        4.For 64-bit fortran users; if you find linking redefiniation errors 
          at project fortestf.vfproj and project hdftestf.vfproj; you may do 
          the followings:
          right click fortestf.vfproj->properties->Linker->Input->Ignore Specific
           library and fill in with msvcrt.lib.
          
           
        
Testing:
    
    We provide a test suite to verify all libraries and tools were built
    successfully.  This test suite should work identically on 32- and 64- bit
    builds.  Therefore, you may follow the instructions in Section I about
    testing.  Note that because 64-bit binaries were built, these tests must 
    run on a 64-bit machine.
        
Installing:

    We provide a script that will install all headers, libraries, and tools
    into one folder, hdf4lib.  This script should work identically on 32- and 
    64-bit  builds.  Therefore, you may follow the instructions in Section I 
    about installing.  
 

 
Section XI: Build HDF4 on Windows Vista
======================================================================

Building on Windows Vista is very similar to building on Windows XP, with
some minor changes.  Therefore, follow the build instructions above, with the
following considerations:

    1. Only Visual Studio 2005 is currently supported on Windows Vista.  This
       is because Microsoft has ended their support for 6.0 and .NET.
       
    2. Building Fortran libraries has not been tested, and is therefore also
       unsupported.  You may attempt to build Fortran libraries following the
       instructions above, but they should be considered experimental and used
       for testing only.

    3. You need to use jpeg6b-4 to link with HDF4. You may get the library
       from ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/jpeg/bin/windows/ and find jpeg6b-4
       zip file for vista and install it on your machine.
       
    4. Elevated security permissions are required to test the HDF4 libraries.
       This is because DLLs are installed in the system directory.  To enable
       elevated security:
       
            1. In the Start menu, search for "Command Prompt".  Right click on
               the "Command Prompt" program, and select "Run as administrator."
               
            2. A security dialog will pop up.  Make sure you select "Continue."
            
            3. Test HDF4 libraries and tools as usual using "hdf4check.bat"
               script.




Section XII: Some Helpful Pointers
======================================================================

(as described in terms of installing the no fortran configuration)

Here are some notes that may be of help if you are not familiar
with using the Visual Studio environment.

Project name and location issues: 

   The file Win32.zip is now depreciated.  Instead, use copy_hdf.BAT in the 
   .\windows directory.

   If you must install project files in another directory relative to HDF42r3\ , 
   you will be asked to locate all sub-project files when you open the project 
   all.sln.

   If you want to rename all (the entire project), you will need to modify two 
   files all.sln and all.vcproj as text (contrary to the explicit warnings in 
   the files).

   You can also modify all.sln and all.vcproj as text, to allow these two
   files to be installed in another directory.

Settings... details:
   If you create your own project, the necessary settings can be
   read from the all.vcproj file(as text), or from the Project Settings
   in the Visual Studio project settings dialog.


   Project

                                       or Single-Threaded debug
                                       or Multi-Threaded DLL
                                       or Multi-Threaded debug DLL
